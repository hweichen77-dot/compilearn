      "explanation": "## Every Innovation Cuts Both Ways\n\nA **computing innovation** is any program, physical device, or system that includes a program as an integral part of its function. The AP CSP framework stresses one core idea: the same innovation can produce both **beneficial effects** and **harmful effects**, often at the same time and often unintended.\n\n- **Beneficial effect**: a positive outcome for individuals, groups, or society (faster communication, medical diagnosis, accessibility tools).\n- **Harmful effect**: a negative outcome, which may be unintended (privacy loss, addiction, misinformation, job displacement).\n\n## Intended vs. Unintended\n\nWhen people create an innovation they have a goal, but real-world use frequently exceeds that goal. Social media was built to connect people (beneficial) yet also spreads misinformation (harmful). The exam expects you to recognize that **harmful effects are frequently unintended** and that an effect can be beneficial for one group while harmful for another.\n\n## Effects Are Not Symmetric\n\nWhether an effect is judged beneficial or harmful depends on context, perspective, and time. A useful reasoning skill is *counting and comparing* effects to estimate net impact.\n\n```python\n# Tally beneficial vs harmful effects of an innovation\neffects = [\"beneficial\", \"harmful\", \"beneficial\", \"beneficial\"]\nben = effects.count(\"beneficial\")\nharm = effects.count(\"harmful\")\nprint(\"net:\", ben - harm)\n```\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Innovations have **dual effects**: analyze both sides.\n- **Unintended consequences** are a defining theme of Big Idea 5.\n- The *same* innovation can help and harm different stakeholders.\n- Always ask: *beneficial for whom, harmful for whom?*\n\nIn free-response answers, name a specific innovation, then give one concrete beneficial effect and one concrete harmful effect. Vague claims like \"it is bad for society\" earn no credit; specificity does.",

      "title": "The Digital Divide",
      "explanation": "## What the Digital Divide Is\n\nThe **digital divide** is the unequal access to computing devices and the internet across different groups, shaped by factors such as income, geography (rural vs. urban), age, education, and country. People without reliable access are cut off from online education, jobs, healthcare, and government services, which can widen inequalities that already exist.\n\nThe divide exists at multiple levels:\n\n- **Access**: do you have a device and a connection at all?\n- **Quality**: is the connection fast and reliable?\n- **Skills**: do you know how to use the technology effectively?\n\n## Why It Matters for the Exam\n\nThe framework links the digital divide directly to **equity**. As more services move online, the gap does not stay flat, it compounds. A student without home internet falls behind in ways that affect future income and opportunity. The divide is therefore both a *cause* and an *effect* of inequality.\n\n## Measuring Access Gaps\n\nWe can quantify a divide by comparing access rates between groups. A larger gap means a deeper divide.\n\n```python\n# Access rate per group, then the gap between them\nrural = 60 / 100   # 60 of 100 households connected\nurban = 92 / 100   # 92 of 100 households connected\ngap = urban - rural\nprint(round(gap, 2))  # 0.32\n```\n\n## Closing the Gap\n\n- Expand affordable broadband and public access points (libraries, schools).\n- Subsidize devices for low-income households.\n- Teach digital literacy so access translates into capability.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- The **digital divide** is about *unequal access*, not just having no internet.\n- It operates at access, quality, and skill levels.\n- Left unaddressed, it **deepens social inequality**; deliberate policy can narrow it.",

      "explanation": "## Bias Lives in Computing Systems\n\nComputing innovations can reflect **existing human biases** because people build them and people supply their data. A biased system produces systematically unfair outcomes for some groups. The exam calls a key point out clearly: bias is **not always intentional**: it often slips in unnoticed.\n\n## Where Bias Enters\n\n- **Biased training data**: a hiring model trained mostly on resumes from one group learns to favor that group.\n- **Biased design choices**: deciding which features matter encodes the designer's assumptions.\n- **Biased use**: even a fair tool can be applied unfairly by its users.\n\n## Detecting Bias\n\nA common technique is comparing **outcome rates across groups**. If a fair process should approve people at similar rates, a large difference is a red flag worth investigating.\n\n```python\n# Compare approval rates by group\napproved = {\"A\": 30, \"B\": 10}\ntotal = {\"A\": 50, \"B\": 50}\nfor g in approved:\n    rate = approved[g] / total[g]\n    print(g, round(rate, 2))\n# A 0.6   B 0.2  -> a 3x gap signals possible bias\n```\n\n## Reducing Bias\n\n- Audit datasets for representation **before** training.\n- Test outputs across groups **after** deployment.\n- Include diverse perspectives on the design team.\n\nNote that detecting a gap is not proof of bias by itself, real differences can exist, but unexplained, large gaps demand scrutiny.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Bias can come from **data, design, or use**.\n- It is **frequently unintentional**, so creators must actively test for it.\n- Comparing outcome rates across groups is a practical detection tool.",

      "explanation": "## Harnessing the Crowd\n\n**Crowdsourcing** is the practice of obtaining input, ideas, content, or funding by enlisting the services of a large number of people, typically via the internet. The web makes it possible to coordinate contributions from strangers around the world at very low cost.\n\n## Why Crowdsourcing Works\n\n- **Scale**: thousands of small contributions add up to something no individual could build.\n- **Diversity**: many perspectives surface ideas an expert team would miss.\n- **Speed**: many people working in parallel solve problems quickly.\n\nClassic examples include collaborative encyclopedias, citizen-science projects that classify galaxies or count wildlife, **crowdfunding** platforms that raise money for projects, and product reviews that aggregate many opinions.\n\n## Strengths and Limits\n\nCrowdsourcing can democratize problem-solving, but quality control is a challenge: contributions vary in accuracy, and the crowd can be manipulated. Good systems combine crowd input with **review, voting, or reputation** to keep quality high.\n\n```python\n# Aggregate ratings from many contributors\nratings = [5, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5]\naverage = sum(ratings) / len(ratings)\nprint(round(average, 2))  # 4.33\n```\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- **Crowdsourcing** gathers contributions from many people, usually online.\n- It excels at **scale, diversity, and speed**.\n- **Crowdfunding** is crowdsourcing applied to money.\n- Aggregation and review keep crowd contributions trustworthy.\n\nOn the exam, recognize that the *internet* is what makes large-scale crowdsourcing feasible, and that it can produce both high-quality outcomes and low-quality noise.",

      "explanation": "## Legal vs. Ethical\n\nBig Idea 5 separates two ideas that often overlap but are not the same:\n\n- **Legal** concerns ask: *does this follow the law?* Laws govern hacking, data protection, copyright, and more.\n- **Ethical** concerns ask: *is this right, even if it is legal?* Something can be perfectly legal yet still harmful or unfair.\n\nThe exam wants you to weigh both. Collecting user data with a vague consent banner may be legal but still ethically questionable.\n\n## Common Concerns\n\n- **Privacy**: how much personal data should a company gather and keep?\n- **Surveillance**: monitoring can improve safety but erode freedom.\n- **Unauthorized access**: breaking into systems is both illegal and unethical.\n- **Plagiarism and copyright**: using others' work without permission.\n\n## Reasoning About Trade-offs\n\nEthical analysis often weighs benefits against harms across stakeholders. A simple model assigns scores and compares totals, but remember real ethics is richer than arithmetic.\n\n```python\n# Weigh benefit vs harm for a data-collection feature\nbenefit = 7   # better recommendations\nharm = 9      # privacy loss\nverdict = \"reconsider\" if harm > benefit else \"acceptable\"\nprint(verdict)  # reconsider\n```\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- **Legal** is about laws; **ethical** is about right and wrong, they can diverge.\n- Privacy, surveillance, unauthorized access, and plagiarism are recurring concerns.\n- Strong answers consider **multiple stakeholders** and weigh harms against benefits.\n\nWhen a free-response prompt asks about a concern, state whether it is legal, ethical, or both, and explain *who* is affected.",

      "explanation": "## What Counts as PII\n\n**Personally identifiable information (PII)** is data that can identify a specific individual, on its own or combined with other data. Examples include full name, address, Social Security number, phone number, email, biometric data, and location history. The AP framework stresses that PII can be exploited if it falls into the wrong hands.\n\n## How PII Spreads\n\n- **Directly**: you type it into forms and profiles.\n- **Indirectly**: apps collect device IDs, search history, and location in the background.\n- **By combination**: seemingly harmless data points can be **linked** to re-identify a person even after a name is removed.\n\nThat last point is crucial: removing an obvious identifier does not guarantee anonymity, because combinations of fields (ZIP code + birthdate + gender) can still pinpoint someone.\n\n## Risks and Protections\n\nLeaked PII enables identity theft, stalking, and targeted scams. Sensible protections include sharing the **minimum necessary** data, using privacy settings, and being skeptical of apps that request more than they need.\n\n```python\n# Flag fields that are PII\nfields = [\"name\", \"favorite_color\", \"ssn\", \"email\"]\npii = {\"name\", \"ssn\", \"email\", \"address\", \"phone\"}\nflagged = [f for f in fields if f in pii]\nprint(flagged)  # ['name', 'ssn', 'email']\n```\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- **PII** is any data that can identify an individual, alone or combined.\n- Data can be collected **directly, indirectly, or by combination**.\n- Removing a name is **not** the same as true anonymity.\n- Minimize what you share and guard sensitive fields like SSN and location.",
