      "explanation": "Before a program can make a decision, it needs a way to ask a yes-or-no question. The answer to such a question is a **Boolean** value: exactly one of `True` or `False`. Every loop that stops, every `if` that fires, and every search that succeeds rests on Boolean logic.\n\n## Relational operators\n\nA **relational operator** compares two values and produces a Boolean:\n\n- `==` equal to (note: two equals signs, not one)\n- `!=` not equal to\n- `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` the usual orderings\n\n```python\nprint(7 == 7)    # True\nprint(3 != 3)    # False\nprint(5 > 9)     # False\nprint(4 <= 4)    # True\n```\n\nWatch the difference between `=` (assignment, stores a value) and `==` (comparison, asks a question). Mixing them up is the most common Boolean bug.\n\n## Logical operators\n\nYou combine Boolean values with three **logical operators**:\n\n- `and`, True only if **both** sides are True\n- `or`, True if **at least one** side is True\n- `not`, flips True to False and vice versa\n\n```python\nage = 16\nhas_id = True\nprint(age >= 18 and has_id)   # False (first side fails)\nprint(age >= 18 or has_id)    # True  (second side holds)\nprint(not has_id)             # False\n```\n\nThe AP exam uses the words `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` in pseudocode; the meaning is identical. A handy reference is the **truth table** for `and`: only `True and True` yields `True`; every other combination is `False`. For `or`, only `False or False` yields `False`.\n\n## Short-circuit evaluation\n\nPython stops as soon as the answer is known. In `a and b`, if `a` is False the whole expression is False and `b` is never checked. This **short-circuit** behavior matters when the second test could be slow or unsafe.\n\n## Why it matters\n\nBoolean expressions are the language of conditions. Master comparing values and combining the results, and you can express any rule a decision or loop will ever need.",

      "xp_reward": 10,
      "explanation": "A program that always does the same thing is just a calculator. **Conditionals** let code choose a path based on a Boolean condition, this is called **selection**, one of the three pillars of Big Idea 3 alongside sequencing and iteration.\n\n## The if statement\n\n```python\ntemp = int(input())\nif temp > 30:\n    print(\"Hot\")\n```\n\nPython evaluates the condition `temp > 30`. If it is **True**, the indented block runs; if **False**, the block is skipped entirely. Indentation is how Python knows what belongs inside the `if`.\n\n## if / else: two paths\n\nWhen you want one action for True and a different action for False, add `else`:\n\n```python\nif temp > 30:\n    print(\"Hot\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Not hot\")\n```\n\nExactly one branch runs, never both, never neither.\n\n## elif: many paths\n\nFor several mutually exclusive cases, chain `elif` (\"else if\"). Python checks each condition top to bottom and runs the **first** one that is True, then skips the rest:\n\n```python\nscore = int(input())\nif score >= 90:\n    print(\"A\")\nelif score >= 80:\n    print(\"B\")\nelif score >= 70:\n    print(\"C\")\nelse:\n    print(\"F\")\n```\n\nA score of 95 matches the first test and prints `A`. A score of 82 fails the first test, passes `score >= 80`, prints `B`, and the remaining branches are never examined. **Order matters**: if you wrote `score >= 70` first, every passing grade would print `C`.\n\n## The AP pseudocode form\n\nThe exam writes this as `IF (condition) { ... } ELSE { ... }`. The block structure is the same; Python just uses indentation instead of braces.\n\n## Why it matters\n\nSelection is how software responds to data: validating input, branching on user choices, classifying values. Combined with the Boolean logic from the previous lesson, `if`/`elif`/`else` lets a program react differently to every situation it meets.",

      "xp_reward": 10,
      "explanation": "Real decisions often depend on a second question *only after* a first one is answered. Placing one conditional **inside** another creates a **nested conditional**, letting you express layered rules.\n\n## A conditional inside a conditional\n\nImagine a movie ticket. Children under 13 always pay $5. For everyone else, the price depends on whether they are a member:\n\n```python\nage = int(input())\nmember = input().strip()\nif age < 13:\n    price = 5\nelse:\n    if member == \"yes\":\n        price = 8\n    else:\n        price = 12\nprint(price)\n```\n\nThe outer `if` splits people into *child* vs. *everyone else*. Only inside the `else` branch, the adult path, does the program ask the second question about membership. A child never reaches the membership test at all. This is the essence of **nested selection**: the inner decision is reached only when the outer condition has already been settled.\n\n## Reading the indentation\n\nIndentation shows the nesting depth. The inner `if/else` is indented one level further because it lives inside the outer `else`. Trace it carefully:\n\n- `age = 10` -> outer condition True -> `price = 5`, inner block skipped.\n- `age = 30, member = \"yes\"` -> outer False -> inner True -> `price = 8`.\n- `age = 30, member = \"no\"` -> outer False -> inner False -> `price = 12`.\n\n## Nesting vs. elif\n\nMany nested chains can be flattened with `elif`, which is often clearer. But true nesting shines when the inner question is **meaningful only** in one branch, like asking about membership only for non-children. The AP exam draws these as boxes inside boxes; in pseudocode you would see `IF { IF { } ELSE { } }`.\n\n## Why it matters\n\nNested conditionals model the layered logic of the real world: eligibility checks, pricing tiers, game states. Learning to read and write them, and to trace which path the data takes, prepares you for the branching logic at the heart of every nontrivial algorithm.",

      "explanation": "**Iteration** means repeating a block of code. When you do not know in advance how many repetitions you need, you only know a *condition* for stopping, you reach for a **while loop**. This is **indefinite iteration**.\n\n## Anatomy of a while loop\n\n```python\nn = 10\nwhile n > 0:      # condition checked BEFORE each pass\n    print(n)\n    n = n - 1     # update that moves toward stopping\nprint(\"Liftoff\")\n```\n\nA while loop repeats as long as its condition is True. Each pass:\n\n1. Check the condition. If False, exit the loop.\n2. If True, run the body.\n3. Return to step 1.\n\nThe key detail is the **update**: `n = n - 1` changes the variable the condition depends on. Without it the condition would stay True forever.\n\n## The infinite loop trap\n\nIf the body never makes the condition False, you get an **infinite loop**: the program runs forever:\n\n```python\nn = 10\nwhile n > 0:\n    print(n)   # forgot to change n -> never stops!\n```\n\nEvery while loop needs three things: a starting value, a condition, and an update inside the body that drives the condition toward False.\n\n## A real example: the Collatz steps\n\nThe **Collatz process** takes a number and repeats: if even, halve it; if odd, triple it and add one. It always reaches 1, but the number of steps is unpredictable, perfect for a while loop:\n\n```python\nn = 6\nsteps = 0\nwhile n != 1:\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        n = n // 2\n    else:\n        n = 3 * n + 1\n    steps = steps + 1\nprint(steps)   # 8\n```\n\nYou cannot know the step count ahead of time, so a counted loop will not do, but the condition `n != 1` tells you exactly when to stop.\n\n## Why it matters\n\nWhile loops handle the open-ended repetition that fills real software: reading input until a sentinel, retrying until success, simulating until a goal is met. Always pair a condition with an update, or the loop will never end.",

      "explanation": "When you *do* know how many times to repeat, once per item in a list, or a fixed number of times, a **for loop** is cleaner than a while loop. This is **definite iteration**: the count is known before the loop begins.\n\n## Looping a fixed number of times\n\n```python\nfor i in range(5):    # i takes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n    print(i)\n```\n\n`range(5)` produces the sequence 0,1,2,3,4, five values, starting at 0. The loop variable `i` automatically becomes each value in turn. No manual update is needed, so for loops cannot accidentally run forever the way while loops can.\n\n## Traversing a list\n\nThe most important use of a for loop is the **list traversal**: visiting every element exactly once:\n\n```python\nscores = [88, 92, 75, 100]\ntotal = 0\nfor s in scores:        # s = each value in turn\n    total = total + s\nprint(total)            # 355\n```\n\nThe form `for s in scores` hands you each element directly. To accumulate a result, you keep a variable (here `total`) updated on every pass, this pattern is called an **accumulator**.\n\n## Counting with a condition\n\nTraversal plus a conditional lets you count matching elements:\n\n```python\nnums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]\nevens = 0\nfor v in nums:\n    if v % 2 == 0:      # is v even?\n        evens = evens + 1\nprint(evens)            # 3\n```\n\nThe operator `%` is the **modulo** (remainder); `v % 2 == 0` is True exactly when `v` is even.\n\n## When to use which loop\n\n- **for**: known count or \"do this for each element\": definite iteration.\n- **while**: \"repeat until a condition changes\": indefinite iteration.\n\nWhen you need positions instead of values, use `for i in range(len(nums))` and access `nums[i]`.\n\n## Why it matters\n\nNearly every list algorithm, summing, averaging, counting, finding a maximum, filtering, is a traversal. Pair a for loop with an accumulator or a counter, and you can process a data set of any length with a few clear lines.",

      "explanation": "Searching, finding whether and where a value lives in a list, is one of the most common tasks in computing. The simplest method is **linear search**: check each element in order until you find the target or run out of elements.\n\n## The algorithm\n\nLinear search is just a list traversal with a goal:\n\n```python\nnums = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23]\ntarget = 15\nfound_index = -1\nfor i in range(len(nums)):\n    if nums[i] == target:\n        found_index = i\n        break          # stop early, no need to keep looking\nprint(found_index)     # 2\n```\n\nKey ideas:\n\n- Walk the list by **index** with `range(len(nums))` so you can report *where* the match is.\n- Use a sentinel like `-1` to mean \"not found yet.\"\n- When a match is found, record the index and `break` out of the loop, there is no reason to keep checking.\n- If the loop finishes without a match, the sentinel `-1` remains.\n\n## Works on any list\n\nThe great strength of linear search is that it makes **no assumptions** about the data. The list can be in any order, sorted or not, numbers or names. As long as you can compare elements for equality, linear search works.\n\n## Cost and efficiency\n\nHow much work is it? In the **worst case**: the target is last, or absent, linear search examines **all n elements**. We say it does work proportional to `n`; doubling the list roughly doubles the time. For a list of a million items, that is up to a million comparisons. On a short or unsorted list this is perfectly fine, but for large sorted data there is a far faster method, which you will meet in the next lesson.\n\n## Why it matters\n\nLinear search is the baseline every other search is measured against. It is simple, always correct, and works on unsorted data, the trade-off is speed. Understanding *why* it can be slow sets up the central idea of algorithmic efficiency: doing the same job with dramatically less work.",

But if a list is **already sorted**, you can do dramatically better with **binary search**: the algorithm you use instinctively when looking up a word in a dictionary: open to the middle, decide which half holds your word, and repeat.\n\n## The strategy: halve the search space\n\nBinary search keeps two pointers, `lo` and `hi`, marking the current search range. Each pass it looks at the **middle** element and discards half the remaining list:\n\n```python\nnums = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23]   # MUST be sorted\ntarget = 16\nlo = 0\nhi = len(nums) - 1\nidx = -1\nwhile lo <= hi:\n    mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n    if nums[mid] == target:\n        idx = mid\n        break\n    elif nums[mid] < target:\n        lo = mid + 1     # target is in the right half\n    else:\n        hi = mid - 1     # target is in the left half\nprint(idx)               # 4\n```\n\nEach comparison has three outcomes:\n\n- **Equal**: found it; stop.\n- **Middle too small**: the target must be to the right, so move `lo` past `mid`.\n- **Middle too big**: the target must be to the left, so move `hi` before `mid`.\n\nWhen `lo` passes `hi`, the range is empty and the target is absent.\n\n## Why it is so fast\n\nEvery pass throws away **half** the remaining elements. A list of 1,000 items is cut to 500, 250, 125, ... reaching one element in only about 10 steps. In general binary search needs about **log base 2 of n** comparisons, for a million items, roughly 20 instead of a million. This is the difference between work proportional to `n` and work proportional to `log n`.\n\n## The one requirement\n\nBinary search only works on a **sorted** list. On unsorted data the \"which half\" decision is meaningless and the result is wrong. That is the trade-off: linear search is universal but slow; binary search is blazing fast but demands sorted input.\n\n## Why it matters\n\nBinary search is the classic illustration of algorithmic efficiency, same problem, exponentially less work, just by exploiting structure in the data. Recognizing when you can halve a search space is a core problem-solving skill in Big Idea 3.",

      "explanation": "You now have the full toolkit, Booleans, conditionals, loops, traversals, and search. This lesson combines them into **simulation** and steps back to ask two big questions of Big Idea 3: how *fast* can a problem be solved, and are there problems no program can solve at all?\n\n## Simulation: modeling a process step by step\n\nA **simulation** uses a program to imitate a real or hypothetical process, advancing it one step at a time inside a loop. Consider a walker on a number line who takes a series of steps left (`L`) or right (`R`):\n\n```python\nsteps = input().split()   # e.g. [\"R\", \"R\", \"L\"]\npos = 0\nfor s in steps:\n    if s == \"L\":\n        pos = pos - 1\n    else:\n        pos = pos + 1\nprint(pos)                # final position\n```\n\nEach loop pass updates the **state** (`pos`) according to a rule. Real simulations model weather, traffic, populations, or games this way, track the state, apply the rules, repeat. When real processes are random, simulations use randomness; here we keep it deterministic so the result is exact.\n\n## Efficiency: not all algorithms are equal\n\nThe search lessons showed two algorithms for one job with wildly different costs, linear search does work proportional to `n`, binary search proportional to `log n`. **Efficiency** measures how an algorithm's work grows as the input grows. AP CSP describes an efficient algorithm as one that runs in a **reasonable amount of time**. Some problems have fast solutions; others (like trying every possible combination) blow up so quickly that they can only be solved in **unreasonable time** (also called *intractable*): solvable in principle, but not in any practical amount of time for large inputs.\n\n## Undecidability: some problems have no algorithm\n\nFinally, a few problems cannot be solved by *any* program, no matter how clever or fast. The famous example is the **Halting Problem**: there is no general algorithm that can decide, for every possible program and input, whether that program will eventually stop or loop forever. Such problems are called **undecidable**. They mark a hard boundary on what computing can ever do.\n\n## Why it matters\n\n- **Simulation** turns loops and conditionals into a tool for modeling the world.\n- **Efficiency** explains why algorithm choice can mean seconds versus centuries.\n- **Undecidability** reminds us that computing, for all its power, has real limits.\n\nTogether these ideas close out Big Idea 3: you can not only write algorithms, but reason about how good, and how possible, they are.",
