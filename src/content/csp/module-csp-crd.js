      "explanation": "## Why Collaboration Matters\n\nComputing innovations are rarely built alone. **Collaboration** is the practice of multiple people working together toward a shared goal, and it is a core skill in the AP CSP Creative Development big idea. Diverse teams produce better software because different backgrounds surface different ideas, edge cases, and user needs.\n\nEffective collaboration relies on a few key behaviors:\n\n- **Communication**: sharing ideas clearly and listening actively.\n- **Consensus building**: agreeing on decisions instead of one person dictating.\n- **Conflict resolution**: handling disagreement constructively.\n- **Constructive feedback**: critiquing the work, not the person.\n\n## Pair Programming\n\nA widely used model is **pair programming**, where two developers share one workstation. One acts as the *driver* (typing code) and the other as the *navigator* (reviewing and thinking ahead). They swap roles regularly so both understand the whole program.\n\n## Dividing Work With Contracts\n\nWhen a team splits work, members must agree on an **interface contract**: what data is passed in and what comes out. If everyone agrees on the input format and the expected output *first*, people can build their parts in parallel without conflicts.\n\nConsider a simple shared tool that totals each teammate's contribution count:\n\n```python\nparts = input().split()\ntotal = 0\nfor p in parts:\n    total += int(p)\nprint(total)\n```\n\nBecause the input is agreed to be space-separated integers and the output is their sum, one teammate can write the input reader while another writes the totaling logic.\n\n## Diversity Improves Quality\n\nDifferent perspectives catch problems a single developer might miss. A teammate who thinks about accessibility, another who thinks about edge cases, and another who knows the users all combine to make the result stronger.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n- Collaboration improves quality through diverse perspectives.\n- Pair programming shares knowledge and reduces bugs.\n- Agreeing on input/output contracts lets teams divide work cleanly.",

      "title": "Investigating and Designing a Program",
      "explanation": "## Understanding the Problem First\n\nGood software starts long before any code is written. The first phase of development is **investigating**: studying the problem, talking to the people who will use the program, and identifying constraints. Skipping investigation often produces a program that works but solves the *wrong* problem.\n\nDuring investigation, a team gathers **requirements**: clear statements of what the finished program must do. A requirement is testable, like \"the program must output the total of all entered numbers.\"\n\n## Program Design\n\n**Program design** is the planning that turns requirements into a structure. Designers decide:\n\n- what **inputs** the program accepts,\n- what **outputs** it produces,\n- and the steps that connect them.\n\nA helpful design tool is to describe the steps in plain language before coding. For example: *read a line, split it into words, convert each to a number, keep the largest, then print it.* Writing this plan first prevents confusion later.\n\n## From Design to Code\n\nOnce the design is clear, translating it to Python is direct. Here a design that finds the largest contribution becomes code:\n\n```python\n# Design: read numbers, track the maximum, print it\nparts = input().split()\nlargest = int(parts[0])\nfor p in parts[1:]:\n    value = int(p)\n    if value > largest:\n        largest = value\nprint(largest)\n```\n\nNotice the comment records the *design intent*, while the code carries it out.\n\n## Considering Users\n\nDesign always keeps **users** in mind. What input is realistic? What output do users actually need? Designing for users, not just for the programmer, is a hallmark of strong creative development.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n- Investigate before designing; design before coding.\n- Requirements are clear, testable statements of what the program must do.\n- A plain-language plan makes the code easier to write correctly.\n- Always design with real users in mind.",

      "explanation": "## A Process, Not a Straight Line\n\nThe **development process** is the set of steps used to create a program. AP CSP describes four phases that are repeated, not done once:\n\n- **Investigating**: understand the problem and the users.\n- **Designing**: plan the structure, inputs, and outputs.\n- **Prototyping**: build a working but incomplete version.\n- **Testing**: check whether it meets the requirements.\n\nBecause software is hard to get right the first time, the process is **iterative** and **incremental**. *Iterative* means you cycle through the phases repeatedly. *Incremental* means you add a little functionality at a time, checking as you go.\n\n## Building Up One Step at a Time\n\nImagine a tool that should sum only the *even* numbers in a list. Rather than writing everything at once, you build it incrementally. A first increment might just read and echo the numbers; a second adds the even check; a third adds the sum.\n\nHere is a later increment that keeps even values and totals them:\n\n```python\nparts = input().split()\ntotal = 0\nfor p in parts:\n    value = int(p)\n    if value % 2 == 0:\n        total += value\nprint(total)\n```\n\nEach increment is checked before the next is added, so a mistake is caught while the change is still small.\n\n## Feedback Loops\n\nAfter each increment you gather feedback, from tests, teammates, or users, and feed it back into the next cycle. This **feedback loop** is what makes development iterative rather than a single straight line.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n- The four phases are investigate, design, prototype, test.\n- Development is iterative (repeat) and incremental (small steps).\n- Each small change is checked before the next is added.\n- Feedback from each cycle guides the next.",

Building a prototype early reduces **risk**, because problems surface sooner, when they are cheaper to fix.\n\nProfessional teams often build a **minimum viable product (MVP)**: the smallest version that still does something useful and can be shown to users.\n\n## A Prototype Has Limits\n\nA prototype intentionally leaves things out. It might handle only the common case, skip fancy formatting, or assume valid input. That is fine, the goal is *learning*, not perfection. Knowing what a prototype does **not** do is part of using it well.\n\nSuppose the final goal is a price calculator with discounts, tax, and currency formatting. A first prototype might apply just a flat 10% discount:\n\n```python\nprice = int(input())\ndiscounted = price - price // 10   # prototype: flat 10% off\nprint(discounted)\n```\n\nThis prototype lets the team show users the discount idea before investing in tax and formatting.\n\n## From Prototype to Product\n\nFeedback on the prototype drives the next iteration. Maybe users want a different discount, or maybe the idea fails entirely, better to learn that from a cheap prototype than a finished product. Successful prototypes grow, increment by increment, into the full program.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n- A prototype is an early, partial version used to gather feedback.\n- Prototypes reduce risk by exposing problems early and cheaply.\n- An MVP is the smallest useful version you can show to users.\n- Feedback on a prototype guides the next iteration.",

      "explanation": "## What Testing Means\n\n**Testing** compares a program's **actual output** to its **expected output**. When they match, the test passes; when they differ, the test fails and points to a problem. Testing is how a team gains confidence that a program meets its requirements.\n\n## Choosing Good Test Cases\n\nOne test is never enough. Good testers cover several kinds of input:\n\n- **Typical cases**: ordinary, expected values.\n- **Boundary cases**: the smallest or largest allowed value, or the edge of a range.\n- **Empty or unusual cases**: no input, zero, or surprising values.\n\nChoosing inputs whose correct answer you already know lets you check the program objectively.\n\n## A Testable Program\n\nSuppose a requirement says: *given a number, print PASS if it is at least 60, otherwise FAIL.* The boundary value 60 is the most important test, because off-by-one logic errors often hide there.\n\n```python\nscore = int(input())\nif score >= 60:\n    print(\"PASS\")\nelse:\n    print(\"FAIL\")\n```\n\nGood test cases would include `60` (boundary), `100` (typical pass), and `0` (typical fail). Testing exactly at the boundary catches whether `>=` should have been `>`.\n\n## Testing Drives Iteration\n\nWhen a test fails, the team returns to an earlier phase, makes a change, and tests again. This loop continues until all tests pass. Testing is therefore not a final step but a constant companion to development.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n- Testing compares actual output to expected output.\n- Cover typical, boundary, and unusual cases.\n- Boundary values catch common off-by-one logic errors.\n- Failed tests feed the iterative development loop.",

      "explanation": "## Errors Are Part of Programming\n\nEvery programmer produces errors, and a key Creative Development skill is finding and fixing them. AP CSP groups program errors into three kinds:\n\n- **Syntax errors**: the code breaks the language's rules, so it will not run. Example: a missing colon or unmatched parenthesis.\n- **Runtime errors**: the program starts but crashes during execution, such as dividing by zero or converting a non-number to an int.\n- **Logic errors**: the program runs without crashing but produces the *wrong* result because the reasoning is flawed.\n\nLogic errors are the trickiest because nothing announces them; only testing reveals them.\n\n## Spotting a Logic Error\n\nConsider code meant to compute a sum. A logic error hides inside the loop:\n\n```python\nnums = [4, 6]\ntotal = 0\nfor n in nums:\n    total = n        # bug: should be total += n\nprint(total)\n```\n\nThis runs fine but prints `6` instead of `10`. The fix is `total += n`. Because the program never crashes, only a known-answer test exposes the mistake.\n\n## Reducing Errors\n\nProgrammers reduce errors by **validating input** and handling edge cases. For example, counting how many values are positive must work even when some are zero or negative:\n\n```python\nparts = input().split()\ncount = 0\nfor p in parts:\n    if int(p) > 0:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\nHandling each value carefully, including zero, which is *not* positive, avoids logic errors.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n- Errors are syntax, runtime, or logic.\n- Syntax errors stop the program from running at all.\n- Logic errors still run but give wrong results, so testing is needed to find them.\n- Careful handling of edge cases like zero prevents many logic errors.",

For example, computing an average must avoid dividing by zero when the input is empty:\n\n```python\nline = input()\nparts = line.split()\nif len(parts) == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    total = sum(int(p) for p in parts)\n    print(total // len(parts))\n```\n\nThe empty-input guard turns a potential runtime error into a sensible result.\n\n## Program Documentation\n\nThroughout development, teams write **program documentation**: comments and notes that explain *what* the code does and *why*. Documentation helps collaborators understand the code and helps the original author remember decisions later. Good comments explain intent, not the obvious:\n\n```python\n# Guard against empty input so we never divide by zero\nif len(parts) == 0:\n    print(0)\n```\n\nDocumentation must be **kept up to date**: a comment that no longer matches the code is worse than no comment, because it misleads readers.\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nDebugging and documentation work together. Clear documentation makes bugs easier to locate, and a well-debugged program is easier to document accurately. Both are ongoing habits, not one-time tasks.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n- Debugging finds and fixes errors using prints, known-answer tests, and boundary checks.\n- Input guards turn potential crashes into sensible behavior.\n- Documentation explains what code does and why.\n- Comments must be updated whenever the code changes.",

      "explanation": "## What a Program Does\n\nEvery program exists to serve a **purpose**: the problem it solves or the value it provides to users. **Program functionality** is the set of behaviors that fulfill that purpose: the inputs it accepts, the processing it performs, and the outputs it returns. Describing functionality clearly is part of both design and documentation.\n\n## Inputs, Processing, Outputs\n\nMost programs follow an **input → process → output** structure:\n\n- **Input**: data the program receives (from a user, file, or sensor).\n- **Process**: the logic that transforms input into a result.\n- **Output**: what the program produces for the user.\n\nA program's functionality is judged by whether its outputs correctly fulfill its purpose for the expected inputs.\n\n## Bringing the Process Together\n\nThis final lesson combines everything: investigate the need, design the structure, prototype, test, handle errors, and document. Suppose the purpose is a simple grade reporter: read several scores and report the average and whether the class passed (average of at least 60).\n\n```python\n# Purpose: report a class average and pass/fail status\nparts = input().split()\ntotal = 0\nfor p in parts:\n    total += int(p)\naverage = total // len(parts)\nprint(average)\nif average >= 60:\n    print(\"PASS\")\nelse:\n    print(\"FAIL\")\n```\n\nThe input is the scores, the process computes the average, and the output is two lines fulfilling the purpose. Each piece reflects a phase you learned earlier.\n\n## Judging Functionality\n\nA program **functions correctly** when, across typical, boundary, and unusual inputs, its outputs match the requirements. Creative development is the disciplined journey, collaboration, design, prototyping, testing, documentation, and debugging, that gets a program from idea to reliable functionality.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n- A program's purpose is the problem it solves for users.\n- Functionality is the input-process-output behavior that fulfills the purpose.\n- Correct functionality means outputs match requirements across many inputs.\n- The full development process turns an idea into reliable functionality.",
