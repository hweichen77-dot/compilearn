      "title": "The Internet and IP Addresses",
      "explanation": "## What Is the Internet?\n\nThe **internet** is a global network of networks. No single computer or company controls it. Instead, billions of devices connect through shared agreements called **protocols** that let very different machines understand each other.\n\n## Addresses and the Domain Name System\n\nEvery device on the internet has an **IP address** (Internet Protocol address), a numeric label that identifies it. The most common form, **IPv4**, looks like `192.168.1.1`: four numbers (each 0-255) separated by dots. Because there are only about 4.3 billion IPv4 addresses, the newer **IPv6** uses much longer addresses to support far more devices.\n\nHumans prefer names like `codeflow.app`, so the **Domain Name System (DNS)** acts like a phone book, translating names into IP addresses.\n\n## Protocols Make It Work\n\nProtocols are agreed-upon rules for communication. Key examples:\n\n- **IP** routes data to the right address.\n- **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) ensures data arrives complete and in order.\n- **HTTP/HTTPS** define how web pages are requested and sent.\n\nBecause these protocols are **open standards**, anyone can build a device or app that joins the network. This openness is why the internet is **scalable**: it grows without redesign.\n\n## Checking an IPv4 Address\n\nA valid IPv4 address has exactly four parts, each an integer from 0 to 255. Here is how you might validate one part in Python:\n\n```python\ndef valid_part(part):\n    if not part.isdigit():\n        return False\n    n = int(part)\n    return 0 <= n <= 255\n\nprint(valid_part(\"200\"))  # True\nprint(valid_part(\"999\"))  # False\n```\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThe internet's design separates **addressing** (where data goes) from **content** (what the data is). This layered approach means a photo, a video call, and a web page can all travel over the same wires using the same addressing rules. Understanding addresses and protocols is the foundation for everything else in networking.",

      "title": "Packets and Reassembly",
      "explanation": "## Breaking Data into Packets\n\nWhen you send a file over the internet, it is not sent as one big chunk. It is split into small pieces called **packets**. Each packet carries:\n\n- A piece of the **data** (the payload)\n- The **destination** address\n- A **sequence number** so the pieces can be reassembled in order\n\nThis is called **packet switching**. Packets from the same message can take different paths across the network and still arrive correctly.\n\n## Why Packets Can Arrive Out of Order\n\nBecause packets travel independently, packet 5 might arrive before packet 3. The receiving computer uses the **sequence numbers** to reassemble them correctly. If a packet is lost, the protocol can request that it be resent.\n\n## Reassembling a Message\n\nThe receiver collects all packets, sorts them by sequence number, then joins their payloads back into the original message:\n\n```python\n# Reassemble packets given (sequence_number, data) pairs\npackets = [(2, \"world\"), (0, \"hello\"), (1, \"brave\")]\npackets.sort(key=lambda p: p[0])\nmessage = \" \".join(data for _, data in packets)\nprint(message)  # hello brave world\n```\n\n## Why Packet Switching Is Efficient\n\n- **Sharing**: many messages share the same links instead of reserving a private circuit.\n- **Resilience**: if one path is congested, individual packets can take another route.\n- **Granularity**: only the lost packets must be resent, not the whole file.\n\n## The Big Picture\n\nSplitting data into independently addressed packets is the core idea that makes the internet flexible. The sender labels each piece, the network delivers them by any available path, and the receiver puts them back together using the **sequence numbers**. This is the building block we will route, protect, and speed up in later lessons.",

      "title": "Routing: Finding a Path",
      "explanation": "## What Is Routing?\n\n**Routing** is the process of choosing a path for each packet from sender to receiver. Special devices called **routers** read each packet's destination and forward it toward its goal, one **hop** at a time. There is no fixed circuit reserved in advance; routers make decisions dynamically based on the current network.\n\n## The Network as a Graph\n\nWe can model a network as a **graph**: each router is a **node** and each direct link is an **edge**. Finding a route then becomes finding a path between two nodes. The number of links a packet crosses is the **hop count**.\n\n## Breadth-First Search Finds the Fewest Hops\n\nTo find the route with the **fewest hops**, we explore the network level by level using **breadth-first search (BFS)**. BFS visits all nodes one hop away, then two hops away, and so on, so the first time it reaches the destination it has used the shortest path.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque, defaultdict\n\nadj = defaultdict(list)\nfor a, b in [(\"A\", \"B\"), (\"B\", \"C\"), (\"A\", \"C\")]:\n    adj[a].append(b)\n    adj[b].append(a)\n\ndist = {\"A\": 0}\nq = deque([\"A\"])\nwhile q:\n    u = q.popleft()\n    for v in adj[u]:\n        if v not in dist:\n            dist[v] = dist[u] + 1\n            q.append(v)\nprint(dist[\"C\"])  # 1 (direct link A-C)\n```\n\n## Why Hop Count Matters\n\n- Fewer hops usually means **lower latency**, because each router adds a small processing delay.\n- Routers exchange information so each can pick a good **next hop** without knowing the whole network.\n- If the shortest path is congested or down, routing can shift packets onto another path.\n\nRouting is what turns a pile of independent links into a working delivery system: given any source and destination, the network can compute a path. In the next lesson we see what happens when part of that path fails.",

      "title": "Redundancy and Fault Tolerance",
      "explanation": "## Keeping Working When Things Break\n\nA system is **fault-tolerant** if it keeps working even when some parts fail. The internet is built to survive failures of cables, routers, and even whole data centers. The key technique is **redundancy**: providing more than one way to reach a destination.\n\n## Redundant Paths\n\nIf there is only a single path between two points, then one broken link cuts them off. When the network has **multiple independent paths**, a failure on one path can be bypassed by **rerouting** packets along another. The more redundant the connections, the harder it is to disconnect any two points.\n\n## Testing Tolerance by Removing a Node\n\nA simple way to reason about fault tolerance is to ask: *if this router fails, can the source still reach the destination?* We remove the failed node from the graph and check whether a path still exists.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque, defaultdict\n\nadj = defaultdict(list)\nfor a, b in [(\"A\", \"B\"), (\"B\", \"C\"), (\"A\", \"C\")]:\n    adj[a].append(b)\n    adj[b].append(a)\n\nfailed = \"B\"\nseen = {\"A\"}\nq = deque([\"A\"])\nwhile q:\n    u = q.popleft()\n    for v in adj[u]:\n        if v != failed and v not in seen:\n            seen.add(v)\n            q.append(v)\nprint(\"C\" in seen)  # True: A-C link survives losing B\n```\n\n## Redundancy Is a Trade-Off\n\n- More paths mean **higher reliability** but also more cables and equipment to maintain.\n- Redundancy applies beyond links: servers, copies of data, and power supplies are often duplicated.\n- A network with no redundancy has **single points of failure**, where one outage breaks everything.\n\n## The Big Picture\n\nFault tolerance is not about preventing every failure; it is about ensuring the system **degrades gracefully**. By building redundant paths and components, the internet stays usable even as individual parts fail, which is exactly why it has scaled to global size without a central controller.",

      "title": "Bandwidth and Latency",
      "explanation": "## Two Different Measures of Speed\n\nPeople say a connection is \"fast,\" but speed has two distinct meanings:\n\n- **Bandwidth** is the *rate* of data transfer, measured in **bits per second** (for example, megabits per second, Mbps). It is how much data can flow per unit time, like the width of a pipe.\n- **Latency** is the *delay* before data starts arriving, measured in time (for example, milliseconds). It is how long the first bit takes to make the trip, like the length of the pipe.\n\nA satellite link can have **high bandwidth but high latency**, while a short cable can have low latency but limited bandwidth. They are independent.\n\n## Estimating Transfer Time\n\nA simple model of how long a transfer takes adds the startup delay to the streaming time:\n\n```\ntotal_time = latency + (data_size / bandwidth)\n```\n\nWatch the **units**. Bandwidth is in **bits** per second, but file sizes are often in **bytes**. Since 1 byte = 8 bits, you must convert:\n\n```python\nlatency_ms = 20          # one-way start-up delay before the first bit arrives\nbandwidth_mbps = 100     # megabits per second\nsize_MB = 10             # megabytes\n\nbits = size_MB * 8                  # 80 megabits\ntransfer_ms = bits / bandwidth_mbps * 1000  # 800 ms\ntotal = latency_ms + transfer_ms    # 820 ms\nprint(round(total))\n```\n\n## Why Both Matter\n\n- For **large downloads**, bandwidth dominates: a bigger pipe finishes sooner.\n- For **quick back-and-forth** (clicking a link, a game input), latency dominates, because each tiny message still pays the delay.\n- **Throughput**, the actual delivered rate, is usually lower than the rated bandwidth because of overhead and congestion.\n\n## The Big Picture\n\nWhen you evaluate a network, ask *both* questions: how much can flow per second (**bandwidth**) and how long until it starts (**latency**)? Confusing the two leads to bad decisions, like buying more bandwidth to fix a problem that is really caused by delay.",

The most important pairing is **TCP/IP**:\n\n- **IP** (Internet Protocol) handles **addressing and routing**: it gets packets to the right machine but does not guarantee they arrive or arrive in order.\n- **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) runs on top of IP and adds **reliability**: it numbers packets, acknowledges what arrived, retransmits losses, and reassembles the data in order.\n\nThis separation is powerful: IP can stay simple and fast, while TCP handles the messy work of making delivery dependable.\n\n## HTTP: The Web's Protocol\n\nOn top of TCP sits **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol), the language of the web. A browser sends a **request** and the server returns a **response**. A request begins with a **request line**:\n\n```\nGET /index.html HTTP/1.1\n```\n\nThat line has three parts: the **method** (what to do), the **path** (which resource), and the **version**. Common methods include `GET` (fetch a resource) and `POST` (send data). **HTTPS** is HTTP carried over an encrypted connection for security.\n\n## Parsing a Request Line\n\n```python\nline = \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\"\nparts = line.split()\nmethod, path, version = parts\nvalid_methods = {\"GET\", \"POST\", \"PUT\", \"DELETE\"}\nprint(method in valid_methods)  # True\nprint(method, path)             # GET /index.html\n```\n\n## Why Layering Matters\n\n- Each layer has **one job**, so each can be improved independently.\n- HTTP does not worry about lost packets because **TCP** already guarantees delivery.\n- TCP does not worry about finding the machine because **IP** already handles routing.\n\n## The Big Picture\n\nWhen you load a page, your request travels down the stack (HTTP to TCP to IP), across the network, and back up the stack on the server.

      "explanation": "## Doing Work at the Same Time\n\nMost early programs ran **sequentially**: one step finished before the next began. Modern systems often run work **in parallel** to go faster.\n\n- **Parallel computing** uses multiple processors (or cores) on a single machine, each handling part of a problem at the same time.\n- **Distributed computing** spreads work across many separate computers connected by a **network**, such as a data center or a worldwide research project.\n\n## Modeling Parallel Time\n\nWhen tasks run on several workers at once, the job is not finished until the **busiest worker** is done. So:\n\n- **Sequential time** = the sum of all task durations (one worker does everything).\n- **Parallel time** = the load of the **most loaded** worker.\n\n## Balancing the Load\n\nIf tasks are unevenly assigned, one worker can be overloaded while others sit idle. A common heuristic is to assign each task (largest first) to the **currently least-loaded** worker:\n\n```python\ntimes = [5, 2, 1]\nworkers = [0, 0]  # two workers, each starts at 0\nfor t in sorted(times, reverse=True):\n    i = workers.index(min(workers))\n    workers[i] += t\nprint(\"sequential:\", sum(times))   # 8\nprint(\"parallel:\", max(workers))   # 5\n```\n\nHere one worker gets the size-5 task and the other gets 2 + 1 = 3, so the job finishes in 5, not 8.\n\n## Costs of Parallelism\n\n- **Coordination overhead**: splitting work and combining results takes time.\n- **Communication**: distributed workers must send data over a network, which adds latency.\n- **Imbalance**: a single slow worker holds up the whole job.\n\n## The Big Picture\n\nParallel and distributed computing let us tackle problems too big or slow for one processor: rendering films, training models, or serving millions of users. But the gain depends on dividing work **evenly** and keeping coordination cheap. In the next lesson we quantify exactly how much faster parallel work can be.",

      "title": "Speedup and Its Limits",
      "explanation": "## Measuring the Benefit of Parallelism\n\nThe whole point of parallel computing is to finish sooner. We measure that benefit as **speedup**:\n\n```\nspeedup = sequential_time / parallel_time\n```\n\nIf a task takes 60 seconds on one processor and 20 seconds when split across processors, the speedup is 3. A speedup of 1 means no improvement; a speedup of 4 means four times faster.\n\n## Why Speedup Has a Ceiling\n\nYou cannot always cut time perfectly, because some parts of a program **must** run in order. You cannot frost a cake before baking it. The portion of work that can be parallelized determines the maximum gain.\n\nThis idea is captured by **Amdahl's Law**. If a fraction **p** of the work can be parallelized across **n** processors and the rest (1 - p) must stay sequential, then:\n\n```\nspeedup = 1 / ((1 - p) + p / n)\n```\n\n> Optional enrichment: the AP CSP exam only expects `speedup = sequential / parallel` and the qualitative idea that the sequential part limits gains. The Amdahl's Law formula below goes beyond the exam and is here to sharpen your intuition, not to memorize.\n\n```python\np = 0.9   # 90% parallelizable\nn = 4     # 4 processors\nspeedup = 1 / ((1 - p) + p / n)\nprint(round(speedup, 2))  # 3.08\n```\n\n## The Sequential Part Dominates\n\nNotice what happens as **n** grows very large: `p / n` shrinks toward zero, so speedup approaches `1 / (1 - p)`. With 10% sequential work, the speedup can never exceed 10, no matter how many processors you add. The **sequential fraction sets a hard ceiling**.\n\n## Practical Consequences\n\n- Adding processors gives **diminishing returns** once the parallel part is already split thin.\n- **Overhead** from coordination and communication can make real speedup lower than the formula predicts.\n- The best target for optimization is often **reducing the sequential portion**, not just adding hardware.\n\n## The Big Picture\n\nSpeedup tells you whether parallelism is paying off, and Amdahl's Law warns you that it is bounded by the part you cannot parallelize. Understanding this keeps you from the costly mistake of buying more processors to solve a problem that is fundamentally sequential.",
