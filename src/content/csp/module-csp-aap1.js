      "explanation": "Every program needs a way to remember things, a player's score, a user's name, the running total of a bill. In AP CSP that memory comes from **variables**. A variable is a named box that holds a single value, and the value can change as the program runs.\n\n## Assignment\n\nYou put a value into a variable using an **assignment statement**. In Python the operator is `=`, read as \"gets\" or \"is set to\", not \"equals\" in the math sense.\n\n```python\nscore = 0            # create score, store 0\nscore = score + 10   # read old score (0), add 10, store 10\nname = \"Ada\"         # a variable can hold text too\n```\n\nThe right side is evaluated **first**, then the result is stored in the name on the left. So `score = score + 10` looks at the current value of `score`, adds 10, and writes the new value back. The old value is overwritten.\n\nOn the AP exam the equivalent pseudocode is `a ← expression`. The arrow makes the direction obvious: the box on the left receives the value.\n\n## Naming and data types\n\n- **Variable name**: a label you choose. Use clear names like `total`, `userAge`, `firstName`.\n- A variable's value has a **data type**. Common ones: integers (`42`), floating-point numbers (`3.14`), strings (`\"hi\"`), and Booleans (`True`/`False`).\n- Reassigning a variable replaces its value; the variable does not remember its history.\n\n## Reading input\n\nPrograms become useful when they react to data they did not know in advance. `input()` reads one line of text from the user. Because it always returns a **string**, you convert it when you need a number:\n\n```python\nraw = input()        # e.g. the user types \"7\"\nn = int(raw)         # convert string \"7\" to the integer 7\nprint(n * 2)         # 14\n```\n\nForgetting the `int()` conversion is the single most common beginner bug: `\"7\" * 2` gives `\"77\"` (string repetition), not `14`.\n\n## Why it matters\n\nVariables are the foundation of every algorithm. Loops count with them, conditionals test them, and procedures pass them around. Master assignment, value flows **right to left** into a named box that you can overwrite at any time, and the rest of programming builds cleanly on top.",

      "explanation": "A single variable holds one value. But what if you have 30 test scores or a class roster? Creating `score1`, `score2`, ... `score30` is hopeless. The answer is a **list**: one named variable that holds an ordered sequence of values.\n\n## Creating and indexing\n\nIn Python you write a list with square brackets:\n\n```python\nscores = [88, 92, 75, 100]\nprint(scores[0])   # 88  -> the FIRST element\nprint(scores[3])   # 100 -> the LAST element here\nprint(len(scores)) # 4   -> how many elements\n```\n\nEach value sits at a numbered position called an **index**. Python lists are **zero-indexed**: the first element is at index `0`, the second at `1`, and the last at `len(list) - 1`. Reaching past the end (here `scores[4]`) raises an error.\n\n> Note: AP exam pseudocode lists are **one-indexed**: `LIST[1]` is the first element. The idea of ordered, numbered access is identical; only the starting number differs. In runnable Python, always start from 0.\n\n## Common operations\n\n- **Access**: `scores[i]` reads the element at index `i`.\n- **Change**: `scores[0] = 90` overwrites the first element.\n- **Append**: `scores.append(64)` adds a new element to the end.\n- **Length**: `len(scores)` returns the count of elements.\n\n## Traversing a list\n\nMost list work is a **traversal**: visiting every element once, usually with a loop:\n\n```python\nscores = [88, 92, 75, 100]\ntotal = 0\nfor s in scores:        # s takes each value in turn\n    total = total + s\nprint(total)            # 355\nprint(total / len(scores))  # 88.75  (the average)\n```\n\nThe `for s in scores` form hands you each value directly. When you need positions instead, use `for i in range(len(scores))` and access `scores[i]`.\n\n## Why it matters\n\nLists turn a pile of related data into something a single loop can process. Almost every algorithm you will write, summing, searching, finding a maximum, filtering, is built on a list traversal. Once you can store many values together and walk through them, you can manage data sets of any size with the same short block of code.",

An **expression** is any piece of code that evaluates to a single value: `3 + 4`, `price * quantity`, or `total / count` are all expressions. The pieces that combine values are **operators**.\n\n## Arithmetic operators\n\nPython gives you the math operators you expect, plus two that trip up beginners:\n\n```python\nprint(7 + 2)   # 9   addition\nprint(7 - 2)   # 5   subtraction\nprint(7 * 2)   # 14  multiplication\nprint(7 / 2)   # 3.5 true division (always a float)\nprint(7 // 2)  # 3   integer (floor) division\nprint(7 % 2)   # 1   modulo: the remainder\n```\n\nTwo operators do the heavy lifting in countless algorithms:\n\n- **`//` integer division** drops the fractional part: `17 // 5` is `3`.\n- **`%` modulo** gives the remainder: `17 % 5` is `2`. Modulo answers \"is this even?\" (`n % 2 == 0`), \"every 3rd item?\" (`i % 3 == 0`), and \"what digit?\".\n\n## Order of operations\n\nExpressions follow **precedence** rules, just like math class: `*`, `/`, `//`, `%` happen before `+` and `-`. Use parentheses to force the order you want:\n\n```python\nprint(2 + 3 * 4)     # 14, because 3*4 happens first\nprint((2 + 3) * 4)   # 20, parentheses win\n```\n\nWhen unsure, **add parentheses**: they cost nothing and make intent clear.\n\n## Building useful values\n\nA classic pattern: split a total amount into whole units and a remainder.\n\n```python\ncents = 287\ndollars = cents // 100   # 2\nleftover = cents % 100   # 87\nprint(dollars, \"dollars and\", leftover, \"cents\")\n```\n\n## Why it matters\n\nEvery calculation an algorithm performs, averaging scores, converting units, deciding parity, wrapping an index around a list, is an expression built from operators.

      "explanation": "Reading a list is only half the story. Real programs **grow, shrink, sort, and filter** their data. Unlike strings, Python lists are **mutable**: you can change them in place.\n\n## Adding and removing\n\n```python\nitems = [3, 1, 4]\nitems.append(1)      # [3, 1, 4, 1]  add to the end\nitems.insert(0, 9)   # [9, 3, 1, 4, 1]  insert at index 0\nitems.remove(4)      # [9, 3, 1, 1]  remove first 4\nlast = items.pop()   # last = 1, list is now [9, 3, 1]\n```\n\n- **`append(x)`** adds `x` to the end, the most common list operation.\n- **`insert(i, x)`** puts `x` at index `i`, shifting later elements right.\n- **`remove(x)`** deletes the first element equal to `x`.\n- **`pop()`** removes and returns the last element.\n\n## Sorting and reordering\n\n```python\nnums = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]\nnums.sort()        # [1, 1, 3, 4, 5]  in-place, ascending\nnums.reverse()     # [5, 4, 3, 1, 1]\n```\n\n`sort()` changes the list itself and returns `None`, so never write `nums = nums.sort()`, that would store `None`.\n\n## Filtering with a new list\n\nOften you want a list *derived* from another: only the even numbers, or everything except a target. Build a fresh list as you traverse:\n\n```python\nnums = [4, 2, 4, 1, 4]\nkept = []\nfor v in nums:\n    if v != 4:\n        kept.append(v)\nprint(kept)   # [2, 1]\n```\n\nPython also offers a **list comprehension** as a compact form of the same idea:\n\n```python\nkept = [v for v in nums if v != 4]   # [2, 1]\n```\n\n## Joining for output\n\nTo print a list of numbers as a space-separated line, convert each to a string and join:\n\n```python\nprint(\" \".join(str(v) for v in kept))   # \"2 1\"\n```\n\n## Why it matters\n\nFiltering, sorting, and appending are the verbs of data processing. A search engine filters results, a leaderboard sorts scores, a shopping cart appends items. Mastering in-place mutation versus building a new list, and knowing which methods return `None`, keeps your data transformations correct.",

      "xp_reward": 10,
      "explanation": "As programs grow, copying the same block of code in five places becomes a maintenance nightmare. A **procedure** (called a *function* in Python) solves this: you write a named, reusable chunk of logic once and **call** it whenever you need it.\n\n## Defining and calling\n\n```python\ndef greet():\n    print(\"Hello!\")\n\ngreet()   # the call -> prints Hello!\ngreet()   # call again -> prints Hello! again\n```\n\n`def` defines the procedure; `greet()` runs it. This is **abstraction**: the caller uses the name and does not care how the body works.\n\n## Parameters and arguments\n\nProcedures get flexible when you pass data in. A **parameter** is a placeholder named in the definition; an **argument** is the actual value you supply at the call.\n\n```python\ndef square(num):     # num is the parameter\n    print(num * num)\n\nsquare(5)            # 5 is the argument -> prints 25\nsquare(9)            # prints 81\n```\n\nThe argument `5` is copied into the parameter `num` for that one call. Different arguments produce different behavior from the same code.\n\n## Multiple parameters\n\nA procedure can take several parameters, matched by position:\n\n```python\ndef rectangle_area(width, height):\n    print(width * height)\n\nrectangle_area(3, 4)   # width=3, height=4 -> 12\n```\n\nOrder matters: the first argument fills the first parameter, the second fills the second, and so on. The AP pseudocode equivalent is `PROCEDURE rectangleArea(width, height)`, same idea of named inputs.\n\n## Why it matters\n\nProcedures are how programmers manage complexity. They let you:\n\n- **Reuse** logic instead of duplicating it.\n- **Name** an idea so code reads like its intent.\n- **Hide detail** behind a clean interface, the heart of abstraction in Big Idea 3.\n\nIn this lesson the procedure does its work by printing. In the next lesson you will make procedures hand a result back so the caller can keep computing with it.",

      "xp_reward": 10,
      "explanation": "A procedure that only prints is a dead end, the result vanishes to the screen and the program cannot reuse it. A **return value** sends a result back to the caller so computation can continue.\n\n## return hands a value back\n\n```python\ndef square(num):\n    return num * num     # hand the result back\n\nresult = square(6)       # result now holds 36\nprint(result + 4)        # 40, we can keep computing\n```\n\nWhen Python reaches `return`, the procedure **ends immediately** and the call expression *becomes* that value. So `square(6)` literally turns into `36` wherever it appears. A procedure with no `return` hands back the special value `None`.\n\n## Return vs. print\n\nThis distinction is the most important idea in the unit:\n\n- **`print(x)`** shows `x` to the user, then forgets it.\n- **`return x`** gives `x` back to the program so you can store it, add to it, or pass it on.\n\n```python\ndef double_print(n):\n    print(n * 2)     # shows it, returns None\n\ndef double_return(n):\n    return n * 2     # gives it back\n\nx = double_return(5)   # x = 10, usable\ny = double_print(5)    # prints 10, but y = None\n```\n\n## Returning from a loop\n\nProcedures often compute over many inputs and return one answer. A procedure that finds the maximum of three numbers compares and returns:\n\n```python\ndef max_of_three(a, b, c):\n    largest = a\n    if b > largest:\n        largest = b\n    if c > largest:\n        largest = c\n    return largest\n\nprint(max_of_three(3, 9, 5))   # 9\n```\n\nThe AP pseudocode form is `PROCEDURE maxOfThree(a, b, c) { ... RETURN(largest) }`, identical parameter-in, value-out shape.\n\n## Why it matters\n\nReturn values let procedures compose: the output of one becomes the input of another. `total = sum(filter(parse(data)))` only works because each procedure returns something usable.

      "explanation": "When you define variables inside procedures, where do they live, and who can see them? The answer is **scope**: the region of a program where a variable name is valid. Getting scope right is what makes procedures safe, reusable building blocks.\n\n## Local variables\n\nA variable created **inside** a procedure is **local** to that procedure. It is born when the call starts and disappears when the call ends. Code outside cannot see it.\n\n```python\ndef add_tax(price):\n    rate = 0.10           # local to add_tax\n    return price + price * rate\n\nprint(add_tax(100))       # 110.0\nprint(rate)               # ERROR: rate is not defined out here\n```\n\nParameters are local too: `price` exists only during the call. This **isolation** is a feature, two procedures can both use a variable named `total` without interfering, because each `total` lives in its own scope.\n\n## Global variables\n\nA variable defined at the top level of the program is **global**. Procedures can *read* a global value, but assigning to that name inside a procedure creates a **new local** variable instead of changing the global one:\n\n```python\ncount = 0\n\ndef bump():\n    count = count + 1   # ERROR / creates confusion\n\n```\n\nBecause of this, the clean style, and the one AP CSP teaches, is to **pass values in as parameters and return results out**, rather than reaching for globals.\n\n## Why isolation matters\n\nConsider two procedures that each loop with a counter `i`:\n\n```python\ndef count_up(n):\n    line = \"\"\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        line = line + str(i) + \" \"\n    return line.strip()\n\nprint(count_up(3))   # \"1 2 3\"\n```\n\nThe `i` and `line` here cannot collide with an `i` or `line` anywhere else. That guarantee is exactly what lets you combine many procedures into a large program without their internals stepping on each other.\n\n## Why it matters\n\nScope is the rule that makes **abstraction** trustworthy. Because a procedure's locals stay private, you can use a procedure by its name and contract, its parameters and return value, without worrying about what variables it uses inside. That is the foundation for building big programs out of small, independent pieces.",
