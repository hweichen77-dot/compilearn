      concept: "Context window",
      challenge_difficulty: "beginner",

      explanation: `Imagine answering a question while staring at a desk that can only hold a few sheets of paper at once. Anything you want to consider has to fit on that desk. Push a new sheet on and an old one slides off the edge. That desk is the **context window**: the model's entire field of view for a single request.

## What it is

The **context window** is the maximum number of tokens a model can consider in one request. And here's the part people miss: that budget covers **both** what you send in *and* what the model writes out. Input and output share the same desk.

A token is just a chunk of text, roughly 4 characters of English, about ¾ of a word. So a window of, say, 8,000 tokens is room for roughly 6,000 words of *combined* prompt and answer. Modern models advertise windows from a few thousand tokens up into the millions, but the rule is identical at every size: there is a hard ceiling, and everything must fit under it.

## How it works

Think of the window as the model's **working memory**, not its long-term knowledge. Its long-term knowledge is baked into frozen weights during training. The context window is the scratch space it gets *right now*, for *this* request:

\`\`\`python
WINDOW = 8000          # max tokens this model can hold at once
prompt_tokens = 1200   # everything you sent in
# space left for the answer:
budget_for_answer = WINDOW - prompt_tokens
print(budget_for_answer)   # 6800 tokens to write with
\`\`\`

Two things follow immediately. First, the bigger your input, the less room is left for the output. Second, nothing outside the window exists for the model, if a fact isn't in the window (or its frozen training), the model simply cannot see it.

## Why it matters

The window is the single most important constraint shaping how you use a model:

- It explains why a model "forgets" the start of a very long chat, older text fell off the desk.
- It caps how much you can paste in: a 500-page book will not fit in a small window all at once.
- It forces real trade-offs: more context for the question means less room for the reply.

## The mental model to keep

Don't picture infinite memory. Picture a **desk of fixed size**. Everything the model thinks about for this one request, your instructions, the conversation, and its own reply, has to fit on that desk at the same time.`,

      explanation: `You type one short sentence, "What's the weather?", and somehow the request is 1,500 tokens. Where did they come from? You didn't write 1,500 tokens. But the app did, on your behalf, and all of it lands on the same desk.

## What it is

The context window is a **budget**, and almost everything in a request spends from it. Four things, every time:

1. **The system prompt**: hidden instructions the app sends first ("You are a helpful assistant…"). You never see it, but it's there, and it costs tokens.
2. **The full chat history**: every earlier user message *and* every earlier model reply, re-sent on each turn.
3. **Your new message**: the thing you actually typed.
4. **Reserved space for the answer**: the model needs room left over to write its reply, so that headroom counts too.

## How it works

Remember from the foundations: models are **stateless**. The model itself remembers nothing between requests. So to make a chat feel continuous, the app resends the *entire* conversation every single turn. Add it all up and you get the total going into the window:

\`\`\`python
system = 200       # hidden system prompt
history = 1100     # all previous turns, re-sent
new_msg = 30       # what you just typed
reserved = 500     # headroom kept for the answer

used = system + history + new_msg + reserved
print(used)        # 1830 tokens spent before the model writes a word
\`\`\`

This is why a tiny message can still be an expensive request: the small part is *your* text; the large part is everything dragged along with it.

## Why it matters

Knowing what counts changes how you think about long sessions:

- **History grows every turn.** Each exchange adds both your message and the reply to what gets re-sent next time. The budget creeps upward on its own.
- **The system prompt is a fixed tax.** It's paid on every request, so bloated system prompts quietly shrink the room for everything else.
- **You must reserve answer space.** If history eats the whole window, there's nothing left for the model to respond with.

      challenge_difficulty: "intermediate",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Halfway through a long chat, the model suddenly forgets your name, even though you told it ten minutes ago. It isn't being rude or buggy. Your name slid off the desk. This is what running out of context looks like, and it happens in one of two ways.

## What it is

When a request would exceed the window, you hit the ceiling, and there are only two possible outcomes:

- **A hard error.** Some APIs simply refuse: the request is too big, so the call fails with a "context length exceeded" message. Annoying, but at least it's loud.
- **Silent truncation.** Many chat apps quietly **drop the oldest text** to make the new request fit. No error, no warning, the start of the conversation just disappears. This is the dangerous one, because it fails quietly.

Truncation almost always trims from the **oldest** end. The most recent messages are kept; the beginning falls away. That's exactly why a model "forgets" the early parts of a long chat: those tokens were cut to make room.

## How it works

Picture the conversation as a list of turns. When the total tokens exceed the window, the app pops turns off the front until it fits:

\`\`\`python
WINDOW = 100
turns = [40, 40, 40]   # token cost of each turn, oldest first
while sum(turns) > WINDOW:
    dropped = turns.pop(0)   # oldest turn falls off
    print("dropped a turn of", dropped, "tokens")
print("kept:", turns)        # [40, 40], the first turn is gone
\`\`\`

Notice the system prompt and your newest message are kept; it's the middle-aged history that gets sacrificed. The model now answers as if the dropped turns never happened.

## Why it matters

Silent truncation produces confusing, hard-to-debug behavior:

- The model **contradicts** something you established early, because it can no longer see it.
- It **re-asks** for information you already gave.
- Instructions you set at the very start of a long session quietly stop being followed.

None of this is the model "losing focus." It's literally not in the window anymore.

## The mental model to keep

When a chat gets long, the **beginning is the first casualty.** If something matters and the conversation is dragging on, don't assume the model still sees it, it may have already fallen off the front of the desk.`,

      challenge_difficulty: "intermediate",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `So the desk fills up and old sheets slide off. You're not helpless about it. The whole craft of building good AI features is deciding *what stays on the desk*, and there are three reliable moves for keeping the important stuff in view.

## What it is

**Context management** is the practice of choosing what goes into the window so the model always has what it needs and nothing it doesn't. Three core strategies do most of the work:

1. **Trim old turns.** Drop the oldest messages once you're near the limit, like silent truncation, but deliberate and on your terms.
2. **Summarize history.** Replace many old turns with one short summary. Fifty turns of chatter become a three-line recap that costs a fraction of the tokens but preserves the gist.
3. **Keep only relevant chunks.** Instead of stuffing everything in, include just the pieces that matter for *this* question. (Retrieval, a later module, automates picking those pieces.)

## How it works

The shared idea is **spend the budget on signal, not noise.** Summarizing is the highest-leverage move because it shrinks a lot of text into a little while keeping meaning:

\`\`\`python
old_turns = ["hi", "i need help with python", "specifically loops", "for-loops vs while"]
# replace many turns with one compact summary line
summary = "User wants help with Python loops (for vs while)."

before = sum(len(t) for t in old_turns)
after = len(summary)
print("chars before:", before, "-> after:", after)
# the summary captures the point at a fraction of the size
\`\`\`

You can mix strategies: keep the system prompt and the last few turns verbatim, summarize the older middle, and pull in only the relevant document chunks for the current question.

## Why it matters

Good context management is what separates a flaky demo from a dependable assistant:

- It **prevents silent forgetting** by keeping the essentials in the window on purpose.
- It **cuts cost**, since fewer tokens in means a cheaper, faster request.
- It **improves answers**, because a focused window of relevant context beats a bloated one full of noise.

## The mental model to keep

You are the **editor of the desk.** Every request, decide what earns its place: keep what matters, summarize what's bulky, and drop what's noise. **A small, relevant context usually beats a huge, messy one.**`,

      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `You paste a document, the app says "12,000 tokens," and your own back-of-the-envelope math said 9,000. Neither of you is wrong, exactly. You estimated; the app *counted*. Knowing the difference between those two, and when each is good enough, is the whole skill here.

## What it is

There are two ways to measure how many tokens a piece of text will use. The fast way is the **4-characters rule**: divide the character count by 4 and you get a rough token estimate for English. The exact way is to run the model's actual **tokenizer**, the same splitting program the model uses, which tells you the *true* count.

The rule is an approximation. The tokenizer is the ground truth. Your job is to know which one you need for the task in front of you.

## How it works

A tokenizer walks the text and matches it against the model's fixed vocabulary, emitting one token per matched chunk. The 4-chars rule skips all that and just guesses from length. Here's both, side by side:

\`\`\`python
text = "Tokenization is tricky."

# Fast estimate: the 4-characters rule
import math
estimate = math.ceil(len(text) / 4)   # 23 chars -> 6 tokens (guess)

# Exact count: ask the real tokenizer (pretend split here)
real_tokens = ["Token", "ization", " is", " tricky", "."]
exact = len(real_tokens)               # 5 tokens (truth)

print("estimate:", estimate, "exact:", exact)
\`\`\`

The estimate said 6, the tokenizer said 5. Close, but not equal, and that gap is the point.

## Why it matters

The estimate **drifts** from the truth in predictable ways, and the drift bites when you're near a limit or a budget:

- **Rare or messy text undercounts.** A weird name, code, or symbols shatter into many tiny tokens, so 4-chars *underestimates* real usage.
- **Other languages break the rule entirely.** The "4 chars per token" ratio is tuned for English. Other scripts can use far more tokens per character.
- **Near a hard limit, estimates are dangerous.** If you're 200 tokens under an 8k window by your estimate, the real count might be over. When it has to fit, count exactly.

Use the rule for quick "is this roughly affordable?" math. Use the real tokenizer before you send something that must fit, or when money is on the line.

## The mental model to keep

The 4-chars rule is a **speedometer guess**; the tokenizer is the **odometer**. Estimate freely while you're sketching. **When it actually has to fit, count for real.**`,

      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `The first widely used chat models had an 8,000-token window, about a dozen pages. A few years later, some models advertise windows of a million tokens or more, a stack of novels. That is a hundred-fold jump, and it completely changes what a model can do in one request. But bigger is not automatically better, and knowing why is what separates picking a model from guessing at one.

## What it is

Different models ship with very different **window sizes**, measured in tokens. You'll see common tiers:

- **Small (about 8k tokens):** roughly 6,000 words, a short essay or a few files.
- **Medium (about 32k tokens):** roughly 24,000 words, a long report.
- **Large (128k to 200k tokens):** a whole book in one request.
- **Huge (1M+ tokens):** an entire codebase or a shelf of documents at once.

Each tier is just a different ceiling on the same desk from lesson 1. The desk simply got bigger.

## How it works

The window size is fixed per model, you don't grow it, you *choose* it by picking the right model for the task. The deciding factors are how much text the job genuinely needs in view at once, and what that costs:

\`\`\`python
task_tokens = 60000   # how much you actually need in the window

if task_tokens <= 8000:
    model = "small-8k"      # cheapest, fast
elif task_tokens <= 32000:
    model = "medium-32k"
else:
    model = "large-200k"    # fits big inputs, costs more
print("use:", model)        # use: large-200k
\`\`\`

The logic is simple: pick the smallest window that comfortably fits the job, because the bigger windows cost more per request and run slower.

## Why it matters

The window you choose drives both capability and cost:

- **Capability.** A task that needs a 300-page document in view is simply impossible on an 8k model. Sometimes you *need* the big window.
- **Cost and speed.** Larger windows mean you can stuff in more tokens, and more tokens means a bigger, slower, pricier request. Paying for a 200k window to answer a one-line question is waste.
- **Bigger isn't free quality.** A giant window full of irrelevant text can actually *hurt* answers (you'll see why in the next lesson). Room to fit something is not the same as it helping.

## The mental model to keep

Window size is like **choosing a vehicle.** A bike is cheap and quick for a short errand; a moving truck is the only thing that hauls a houseful of furniture, but you wouldn't drive it to buy milk. **Match the window to the load, no smaller, no bigger than you need.**`,

      title: "Lost in the Middle",
      concept: "Position",
      challenge_difficulty: "advanced",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Researchers ran a clean experiment: bury one true fact inside a long context and ask the model to find it. When the fact sat at the very start or the very end, the model nailed it. When the *same* fact sat in the middle, accuracy fell off a cliff. They named the effect **"lost in the middle,"** and once you know it, you'll arrange every long prompt differently.

## What it is

**Lost in the middle** is the tendency of a model to pay **less attention to information in the middle** of a long context than to information at the beginning or the end. The result is a U-shaped accuracy curve: high at the edges, sagging in the center. A fact the model could easily use if placed first becomes easy to miss when buried halfway down a giant prompt.

Crucially, this is about *position*, not whether the fact is in the window at all. The fact fits fine, the model just attends to it weakly because of where it sits.

## How it works

A model spreads its attention unevenly across a long input. The opening and closing tokens get strong, reliable attention; the long stretch in between competes for a thinner slice. So the same content earns different effective weight depending on where you put it:

\`\`\`python
context = [
    "INSTRUCTIONS: answer using the fact below.",  # start: strong attention
    "...lots of filler...",                         # middle: weak attention
    "...more filler...",                            # middle: weak attention
    "KEY FACT: the meeting is at 3pm.",             # near end: strong attention
]
# Put the fact the model must use at an edge, not buried in the filler.
print("place key info at:", "start or end")
\`\`\`

The fix is purely about *arrangement*. Move the must-use information to an edge, and push the low-value filler into the middle where weak attention does the least harm.

## Why it matters

This quietly breaks long-context features that "should" work:

- **Stuffing everything in isn't enough.** A fact can be present in the window and still get ignored because it landed in the dead zone.
- **Order is a lever you control.** Putting instructions first and the critical reference last is a free, reliable quality boost, no model change required.
- **The longer the context, the worse the sag.** A bigger window gives you more room *and* a bigger middle for things to get lost in.

## The mental model to keep

A long context is like a **speech the model half-listens to.** It remembers the opening and the closing; the middle blurs. **Put what must not be missed at the start or the end, never in the murky middle.**`,

      challenge_difficulty: "beginner",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `You have a 500-page manual and a model that holds maybe 200 pages. The question that decides your whole architecture is deceptively simple: do you cram, compress, or fetch? Each answer is a real strategy with real trade-offs, and picking wrong means slow, expensive, or wrong answers. This lesson ties together everything from the module into three named moves.

## What it is

When the input is bigger than what you want in the window, there are three strategies:

1. **Stuff it.** Put as much as fits directly into the window. Simple and complete, until the input outgrows even a large window, or the cost and the lost-in-the-middle effect bite.
2. **Summarize.** Compress the input (or the history) into a shorter form first, then send the summary. Cheap and scalable, but lossy, detail is thrown away.
3. **Retrieve.** Pull in only the chunks relevant to *this* question and send just those. Precise and cheap, but it depends on retrieval actually finding the right pieces.

## How it works

The three differ in what they put on the desk. Stuffing sends everything; summarizing sends a shrunken everything; retrieval sends a tiny relevant slice:

\`\`\`python
doc_tokens = 500000
window = 200000

if doc_tokens <= window:
    strategy = "stuff it"          # fits directly
else:
    # too big to stuff; choose by need
    strategy = "retrieve"          # if only part is relevant per question
    # strategy = "summarize"       # if you need the whole gist, not specifics
print(strategy)                    # retrieve
\`\`\`

The decision hinges on two questions: does it fit, and does the question need *specific* pieces or the *overall* gist? Specific pieces favor retrieval; overall gist favors summarizing; small-enough favors stuffing.

## Why it matters

Each strategy fails in its own way, and matching the failure mode to your task is the skill:

- **Stuffing** is the most faithful but the most expensive, and on huge inputs it triggers cost blowups and lost-in-the-middle misses.
- **Summarizing** scales to any size but **loses detail**: disastrous if the answer hinges on an exact clause you compressed away.
- **Retrieval** is precise and cheap but **fails silently** when it fetches the wrong chunk: the model then answers confidently from incomplete context.

Real systems often **combine** them: retrieve the relevant chunks, summarize the older history, and stuff the small, recent, must-have details verbatim.

## The mental model to keep

Stuffing is **reading the whole book** every time. Summarizing is **reading the back-cover blurb.** Retrieval is **using the index to flip to one page.** **Match the move to the question: whole-thing, gist, or one specific fact.**`,

          prompt: "In your own words: why might a production system combine stuffing, summarizing, and retrieval instead of picking just one?",
          sampleAnswer: "Each strategy is strong where the others are weak: stuffing is faithful but doesn't scale, summarizing scales but loses detail, and retrieval is precise but can miss. A real system gets the best of all three by retrieving the chunks relevant to the current question, summarizing the older history to keep the gist cheaply, and stuffing the small, recent, must-have details verbatim. That way the window holds precise relevant context, a compact memory of the past, and exact recent facts all at once."

      challenge_story: "You're building the dispatcher at the front of a long-context pipeline. Every incoming task carries the size of its input in tokens and a flag for what kind of answer it needs. Your routing policy bundles the whole module's lessons into one rule: if the input **fits** the window, just **STUFF** it (simplest and most faithful). If it doesn't fit, branch on the need, tasks needing **specific** passages go to **RETRIEVE**, tasks needing only the **gist** go to **SUMMARIZE**. After routing a batch, your ops team wants a tally of how many tasks went to each strategy.",
      challenge_statement: "The window size \`W\` is fixed for the batch. You are given \`q\` tasks. Each task has an input size \`t\` (in tokens) and a need flag \`need\` which is either \`specific\` or \`gist\`.\n\nRoute each task:\n\n1. If \`t <= W\`, route to \`STUFF\` (regardless of need).\n2. Otherwise, if \`need\` is \`specific\`, route to \`RETRIEVE\`.\n3. Otherwise (\`need\` is \`gist\`), route to \`SUMMARIZE\`.\n\nPrint three lines, the count routed to each strategy in this order:\n\n1. \`STUFF <count>\`\n2. \`SUMMARIZE <count>\`\n3. \`RETRIEVE <count>\`",
      challenge_input_format: "The first line has two integers \`W q\`: the window size and the number of tasks.\n\nEach of the next \`q\` lines has an integer \`t\` and a word \`need\` (\`specific\` or \`gist\`), space-separated.",
