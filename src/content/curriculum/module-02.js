      explanation: `Open your weather app and pull-to-refresh. In the half-second before the numbers update, your phone just fired a message across the internet to a server it has never met, asked it a question, and got an answer back. That round trip is an **API call**, and your phone makes hundreds of them a day without you noticing.

## What it is

**API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**. Strip the jargon: it's a defined way for your code to ask someone else's code to do something, without you knowing *how* they do it.

The coffee-shop version: you order a latte. You don't walk behind the counter, grind the beans, and pull the shot yourself. You tell the barista what you want, they do the work, they hand you a cup. The counter is the **interface**, the agreed spot where you place an order and receive a result. You never see the espresso machine.

## How it works

When you want Claude to answer a question, you don't run the model on your laptop. You can't. It's hundreds of gigabytes of numbers. Instead your script sends a **request** over the internet to Anthropic's servers. Their code runs the model and sends a **response** back. Your script never touches the machinery.

Every API call is exactly two halves:

- **The request**: what you send. "Here's my question. Here's who I am."
- **The response**: what comes back. "Here's the answer."

That pattern never changes. You send something, you get something back. The whole rest of this module is just learning the precise shape of those two halves for Claude:

\`\`\`text
Your script  --->  request  --->  Anthropic's API
Your script  <---  response <---  Anthropic's API
\`\`\`

## Why it matters

APIs are how modern software is built. Your weather app doesn't own a satellite; it calls a weather API. Your banking app doesn't keep its own copy of the stock market; it calls a finance API. Splitting work across APIs lets each team be great at one thing and lets everyone else borrow that thing with a single call.

For you, that means you can build something that talks to one of the best AI models in the world in about ten lines of Python. You don't need a PhD or a data center. You need two things: an **address** to send the request to, and **permission** to send it. The next three lessons hand you both.

There's a cost side too. Because the work happens on someone else's servers, every call travels the network (so it has **latency**, a small delay) and often costs money. That shapes how you design real programs: you batch calls, cache answers, and avoid hammering the API in a tight loop.

## The mental model to keep

An API is a counter, not a kitchen. You place an order, you wait, you get a result, and you never need to know how the kitchen works.`,

      title: "JSON: How Data Travels",
      concept: "JSON",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Your Python script holds a dictionary. Anthropic's servers run on different code, maybe a different language, on a machine across the country. How do two strangers agree on the exact shape of a message? They both speak **JSON**, a plain-text format with a one-page spec that carries nearly every API request on the internet.

## What it is

**JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation, despite the name it's used everywhere, not just JavaScript) is text arranged as **key-value pairs** inside curly braces. If you've ever filled out a form with labeled boxes (name, email, message), you already understand it.

\`\`\`json
{
  "name": "Ada",
  "age": 36,
  "is_admin": true
}
\`\`\`

Each **key** (left of the colon) is a label. Each **value** (right of the colon) is the data. The rules are tight: strings get double quotes, numbers and \`true\`/\`false\` don't, and commas separate pairs. That's 90% of JSON.

## How it works

The other 10%: a value can itself be a **list** or another box. That nesting is what lets JSON describe complex things.

\`\`\`json
{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "Hello" }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

The square brackets \`[ ]\` hold a list. Inside it, another set of curly braces, a box inside a box. This is exactly the shape of a Claude request. Don't memorize it yet; just notice that it's labeled boxes all the way down.

In Python, JSON is pleasant because a JSON object looks almost identical to a Python **dictionary**. Two functions move between them:

\`\`\`python
import json

person = {"name": "Ada", "age": 36}
text = json.dumps(person)   # dict  -> JSON string
print(text)                 # {"name": "Ada", "age": 36}

back = json.loads(text)     # JSON string -> dict
print(back["name"])         # Ada
\`\`\`

\`json.dumps\` **dumps** a dict out as a JSON string to send. \`json.loads\` **loads** a received JSON string back into a dict you can index. Dump to send, load to read.

## Why it matters

Only **text** can travel over a network, not a live Python object. JSON is the agreed text format both sides serialize to and parse from, which is why it's everywhere. The SDK you'll meet in lesson 4 does the dumps/loads for you, but when an error message mentions a malformed body or you print a raw response, knowing what's underneath means you're never lost.

JSON is also strict, and that strictness causes most beginner errors. Keys and string values **must** use double quotes; single quotes break it. A **trailing comma** after the last pair breaks it too. When an API rejects your request with a vague error, check for a stray quote or comma first.

      title: "API Keys and Rate Limits",
      concept: "Auth & limits",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `In 2023 a developer pasted his cloud API key into a public GitHub repo for "just five minutes" while testing. Automated scanners found it in under a minute and ran up a five-figure bill before he noticed. The lesson is brutal and simple: an **API key** is a password, and the internet never stops scanning for leaked ones.

## What it is

An API key tells Anthropic who's calling, so they can check you're allowed and **bill the right account**. A Claude key is a long string like \`sk-ant-...\`, generated in the Anthropic console. Every request includes it, and the server verifies it before doing any work. No valid key, no answer. You get a \`401 Unauthorized\`.

Treat it exactly like a credit card number. Anyone holding your key can spend your money.

## How it works

The rule that saves careers: **never paste your key into your script.** If it ends up in code you push to GitHub, bots will find it and drain your account.

Instead, store the key in an **environment variable**, a value that lives in your computer's environment, outside your source code. You set it once in your terminal:

\`\`\`bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-key-here"
\`\`\`

Then your script reads it at runtime, and the secret never appears in the file:

\`\`\`python
import os

api_key = os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
print("Key loaded:", api_key is not None)
\`\`\`

Now you can share the code freely; the key stays on your machine. (Use \`.get\` rather than \`os.environ["..."]\` so a missing variable returns \`None\` instead of crashing.)

## Why it matters

The second guardrail is **rate limits**. You can't fire a million requests a second. APIs cap how many **requests or tokens** you can use per minute. Go over and the server replies with \`429 Too Many Requests\` instead of an answer.

Limits exist so one user can't hog a shared service or rack up a runaway bill. While learning you'll never come close, but build something that loops over thousands of items and you'll hit them fast. The fix is to slow down, spread requests out, and **retry after waiting**. Production code does this automatically with **exponential backoff** (wait 1s, then 2s, then 4s, retrying until it succeeds).

A handful of status codes tell you what happened:

\`\`\`text
200 -> success, here's your answer
401 -> your key is missing or wrong
429 -> you're sending too fast, back off and retry
\`\`\`

## The mental model to keep

Keep your key secret like a password, and respect the speed limit like a road sign. 401 means "who are you?"; 429 means "slow down." Everything else is detail.`,

      concept: "Messages API",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Everything so far was setup: the counter, the JSON, the key, the limits. Now you walk up and place the order. About ten lines of Python sends a question to Claude and prints the answer. By the end of this lesson, every line of it will make sense.

## What it is

Anthropic ships an **SDK** (Software Development Kit), a Python library that wraps the raw API so you don't hand-build the JSON. Install it once:

\`\`\`bash
pip install anthropic
\`\`\`

An SDK builds the JSON request, attaches your key, sends it over the network, and hands you back a tidy object. You *could* do all that with the \`requests\` library and a hand-written dict, but the SDK is simply less to get wrong.

## How it works

Here is the whole program:

\`\`\`python
import os
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(api_key=os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"])

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    max_tokens=200,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Say hello in one short sentence."}
    ],
)

print(response.content[0].text)
\`\`\`

Read it top to bottom:

- **client**: your connection. It reads the key from the environment (lesson 3) and holds it.
- **messages.create**: the call itself. Here the request goes out and the response comes back (lesson 1).
- **model**: which Claude to use. \`claude-sonnet-4-6\` is a fast, capable default.
- **max_tokens**: a cap on how long the reply can be, measured in tokens. 200 is plenty for a sentence; set it too low and the answer gets cut off mid-thought.
- **messages**: a list of **turns**. Each turn has a \`role\` (\`user\` is you) and \`content\` (what you said). Recognize the shape? It's exactly the JSON from lesson 2.

## Why it matters

The reply comes back as an object, and the text lives at \`response.content[0].text\`. Why the \`[0]\`? Because \`content\` is a **list of blocks**. A plain text answer is one block (the first), so you grab \`content[0]\` and read its \`.text\`. (The list exists because richer replies can carry multiple blocks, like tool calls, which you'll meet later.)

This is the full loop from lesson 1, made real: you built a request, sent it, the server ran Claude, and you read the response. Change the \`content\` string and you change the question. Wrap it in a loop and you have a chatbot; feed it a document and you have a summarizer. Every Claude program you ever write is a variation on these ten lines.

## The mental model to keep

\`messages.create\` is the counter from lesson 1 with a real menu: hand it a model, a length cap, and your messages list, and read your answer out of \`content[0].text\`.`,

- **Endpoint**: the **URL** you send to, plus the HTTP method. For Claude it's a \`POST\` to \`https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages\`. The method \`POST\` means "I'm sending data up"; the path \`/v1/messages\` names the exact thing you want.
- **Headers**: labeled metadata *about* the request: who you are and what format you're speaking. The two that matter here are your auth header (the API key from lesson 3) and \`content-type: application/json\` (telling the server "my body is JSON").
- **Body**: the actual payload: the JSON object (lesson 2) holding \`model\`, \`messages\`, and parameters like \`max_tokens\`.

## How it works

Picture mailing a package. The **endpoint** is the address on the box. The **headers** are the labels stuck on the outside, return address, "FRAGILE", "contents: documents". The **body** is what's actually inside. The post office routes by the address and labels without ever opening the box. Here is the same Claude call written as a raw request instead of through the SDK:

\`\`\`python
import os, requests

resp = requests.post(
    "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages",          # endpoint
    headers={
        "x-api-key": os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"],  # auth
        "anthropic-version": "2023-06-01",
        "content-type": "application/json",            # body format
    },
    json={                                             # body
        "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
        "max_tokens": 200,
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}],
    },
)
\`\`\`

Three parts, every time: where it goes, the labels on it, the cargo inside. The SDK simply fills these in for you.

## Why it matters

When a request fails, the error usually points at one of the three parts, and naming the part tells you where to look:

- A \`401\` is almost always a **header** problem, a missing or wrong API key.
- A \`404\` is an **endpoint** problem, a typo in the URL or path.
- A \`400\` is usually a **body** problem, malformed JSON, a missing required field, or a value out of range.

Mixing them up wastes hours. Separating endpoint, headers, and body in your head turns a vague "it broke" into a precise "the body is missing \`max_tokens\`."

      title: "Reading the Full Response Object",
      concept: "Response",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `In lesson 4 you grabbed one field, \`response.content[0].text\`, and printed it. That's the headline. But the response that comes back from Claude carries a whole receipt of useful information: an ID for support tickets, the exact model that answered, how many tokens you spent, and *why* the reply stopped. Read the whole object and you can debug, bill, and monitor a real app.

## What it is

A Claude **response** is a JSON object (lesson 2) with a handful of top-level fields. The ones you'll use constantly:

- **id**: a unique identifier for this exact call, like \`msg_01ABC...\`. Quote it when reporting a problem to support.
- **model**: the exact model that produced the reply. Useful when you asked for an alias and want to know what actually ran.
- **role**: always \`assistant\` on a reply (Claude is the one speaking).
- **content**: the list of blocks holding the answer. \`content[0].text\` is the text of a plain reply.
- **usage**: a small object: \`input_tokens\` (what your prompt cost) and \`output_tokens\` (what the reply cost). This is your bill.
- **stop_reason**: *why* generation ended: \`end_turn\` (Claude finished naturally), \`max_tokens\` (it hit your length cap and was cut off), and a few others.

## How it works

Reach into the object the same way you'd index a dict. Here's reading the full receipt:

\`\`\`python
response = client.messages.create(...)

print(response.id)                     # msg_01ABC...
print(response.model)                  # claude-sonnet-4-6
print(response.content[0].text)        # the actual answer
print(response.usage.input_tokens)     # e.g. 12
print(response.usage.output_tokens)    # e.g. 45
print(response.stop_reason)            # "end_turn" or "max_tokens"
\`\`\`

The most operationally important field is \`stop_reason\`. If it reads \`max_tokens\`, the reply was **truncated**: Claude wasn't done, it ran out of room. The fix is to raise \`max_tokens\` and call again.

## Why it matters

The headline text is only part of the value:

- **usage** is how you compute cost (recall the per-token math from module 1) and watch for runaway prompts.
- **stop_reason** is how you detect a cut-off answer *programmatically* instead of eyeballing it. A reliable app checks \`if response.stop_reason == "max_tokens"\` and reacts.
- **id** and **model** make support and monitoring possible, you can log them and trace any single call later.

Ignoring these fields is how beginners ship apps that silently truncate long answers or quietly blow a token budget.

## The mental model to keep

The response is a receipt, not just an answer. The text is the product; **usage** is the price, **stop_reason** is whether the order was complete, and **id** is the receipt number.`,

      concept: "Errors",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Your first ten lines of code assumed every call succeeds. Real networks don't. Servers hiccup, keys expire, you send too fast, a request hangs forever. The difference between a toy script and a reliable app is what happens when the call *fails*. The good news: failures come in a small number of named buckets, and each bucket has a standard response.

## What it is

When a request fails, the API returns an **HTTP status code**: a three-digit number that classifies what went wrong. You met a few in lesson 3; here is the working set:

- **200**: success. Your answer is in the response.
- **400**: Bad Request. *Your* fault: malformed JSON, a missing field, a bad parameter. Retrying won't help; fix the request.
- **401**: Unauthorized. Your API key is missing or wrong. Retrying won't help; fix the key.
- **429**: Too Many Requests. You hit the rate limit. Retrying *after a wait* is exactly right.
- **500 / 503**: the server had a problem or is overloaded. Not your fault; retrying after a wait usually works.

A separate failure is a **timeout**: the request takes too long and your client gives up waiting. No status code at all, the answer simply never arrived.

## How it works

The crucial split: **which errors are worth retrying?** A \`400\` or \`401\` is deterministic, the same request will fail the same way forever, so retrying just wastes calls. A \`429\`, \`500\`, \`503\`, or timeout is **transient**: the same request may well succeed a moment later.

For transient errors, the standard tool is **exponential backoff**: wait a little, retry; if it fails again, wait twice as long; repeat up to a cap.

\`\`\`python
import time

def call_with_retry(send, max_retries=5):
    delay = 1
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        status = send()                 # returns an HTTP status code
        if status == 200:
            return "ok"
        if status in (400, 401):
            return "fatal"              # never retry these
        time.sleep(delay)               # 429/500/503: wait, then retry
        delay *= 2                      # 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, ...
    return "gave up"
\`\`\`

Doubling the wait keeps you from hammering a struggling server, and the retry cap stops an infinite loop when something is truly broken.

## Why it matters

Retry logic is where reliability lives. Retry a \`401\` and you waste a thousand doomed calls; *don't* retry a \`429\` and a brief traffic spike crashes your whole job. Production SDKs (including Anthropic's) build sensible backoff in for you, but you must still decide what to do on a fatal error: surface it to the user, log it, fall back. **The status code is the instruction, read it before reacting.**

## The mental model to keep

Failures are a triage desk. **400/401 are your bug** (fix it, never retry). **429/500/503/timeout are a hiccup** (wait, then retry with exponential backoff). Read the code, then react.`,

      title: "Keeping API Keys Safe",
      concept: "Secrets",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Lesson 3 told you the one rule: never paste your key into your code. This lesson is the full discipline behind that rule, where secrets actually live, how to stop them ever reaching GitHub, and what to do the moment one leaks. Companies have lost serious money to a single committed key. The habits here are cheap insurance.

## What it is

A **secret** is any value that grants access and must never be public: API keys, database passwords, tokens. The professional way to handle one is an **environment variable**: a name-value pair stored in your operating system's environment, *outside* your source files. Your code reads the value at runtime by name; the value itself never appears in the code.

For convenience during development, secrets often live in a **\`.env\` file**: a tiny text file of \`NAME=value\` lines that a loader reads into environment variables when your program starts.

\`\`\`text
# .env  (this file must NEVER be committed)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
\`\`\`

## How it works

The whole pattern is three moves. First, put the secret in a \`.env\` file. Second, the move everyone forgets, add \`.env\` to \`.gitignore\` so Git refuses to track it:

\`\`\`text
# .gitignore
.env
\`\`\`

Third, read it in code by name, never by value:

\`\`\`python
import os

api_key = os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    raise SystemExit("Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in your environment.")
\`\`\`

Notice what's shareable: the code (safe, just reads a name), a committed \`.env.example\` listing the *names* with blank values (safe, documents what's needed), and never the real \`.env\` (secret). A teammate copies \`.env.example\` to \`.env\` and fills in their own key.

## Why it matters

Three more practices separate hobby code from production:

- **Rotation.** Keys should be rotated, replaced with fresh ones, periodically, and *immediately* if you suspect a leak. A leaked key you've already rotated is worthless to an attacker. Treat any key that ever touched a commit as compromised, even after you delete it: Git history remembers.
- **Scoping (least privilege).** Give a key only the access it needs. A read-only key, or one capped to a small spending limit, limits the blast radius if it leaks. Never hand a production-grade key to a throwaway script.
- **Never log it.** Printing a key to logs or error traces leaks it just as surely as committing it. Log \`key is set: True\`, never the key itself.

## The mental model to keep

A secret is a house key. You don't tape it to the front door (hardcode it), you don't mail a photo of it to everyone (commit/log it), and if you lose it you change the lock immediately (rotate). Keep it off the code, off GitHub, and out of logs.`,

          sampleAnswer: "Git records every commit as a permanent snapshot, so deleting the key in a new commit only removes it from the latest version, the old commit that contained it is still in the repository's history and can be checked out by anyone. Public-repo scanners typically find leaked keys within minutes, so by the time I delete it, it's likely already been copied. The only real fix is rotation: revoke the exposed key and issue a new one, which makes the leaked value useless."

      challenge_story: "Before any commit reaches your public repo, a pre-commit scanner sweeps the staged lines looking for secrets that should never be there. The rule your team uses: a line **leaks** a secret if it contains the token prefix \`sk-ant-\` AND the line is NOT a safe reference. A safe reference is a line that only names the variable rather than embedding its value, specifically, lines that read the key by name (containing \`os.environ\`) or document it as a placeholder (containing \`.env.example\`) are allowed even if they mention the prefix in a comment. Build the scanner that flags the leaking lines and blocks the commit if any are found.",
