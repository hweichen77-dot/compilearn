      title: "Chain of Thought",
      concept: "CoT",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Ask a model "What is 17 times 24?" and it often returns a wrong number. Add four words, "Let's think step by step", and the same model works it out and lands on 408. The model itself did not change. What changed is what it wrote first.

## What it is

**Chain of thought (CoT)** is a prompting pattern where you ask the model to write out its intermediate reasoning before giving a final answer. Instead of jumping straight to a conclusion, the model produces a visible trail of steps, and the answer falls out at the end of that trail.

This works because of how models generate text. A model can only "think" by writing tokens; there is no hidden scratchpad. When you force the answer on the first token, the model has done no computation toward it. When you let it write steps first, each step becomes context the next token can build on. The reasoning is not decoration; it is the computation.

## How it works

There are two flavors:

- **Zero-shot CoT.** You append a trigger phrase like "Let's think step by step." No examples needed. The phrase nudges the model into a step-by-step continuation because that pattern is common in its training data.
- **Few-shot CoT.** You show one or two worked examples that include reasoning, then ask your real question. The model imitates the reasoning style it just saw.

Here is the zero-shot version in a prompt:

\`\`\`python
prompt = (
    "Q: A shop has 3 boxes of 12 apples and sells 17. "
    "How many are left?\\n"
    "A: Let's think step by step."
)
# The model now writes: 3 x 12 = 36, then 36 - 17 = 19, then "Answer: 19"
\`\`\`

The trigger doesn't make the model smarter. It changes the *shape* of the output so that the hard part is computed across several tokens instead of crammed into one.

## Why it matters

CoT moves the needle most on multi-step problems: arithmetic, logic puzzles, word problems, and anything requiring a chain of deductions.

- **It trades tokens for accuracy.** Reasoning text costs output tokens and latency. For a simple lookup it is wasted money; for a multi-step problem it is the difference between right and wrong.
- **It makes errors inspectable.** When the answer is wrong, you can read the steps and see where it went off the rails, which is impossible with a one-word answer.
- **It can be hidden.** Many production systems ask for reasoning, then strip it out and show only the final answer to the user.

The catch: more reasoning is not always better. On trivial tasks CoT can introduce errors by overthinking, and a confidently wrong chain of reasoning still produces a confidently wrong answer.

      title: "Few-Shot Done Right",
      concept: "FewShot",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `You ask a model to classify reviews as positive or negative and it keeps replying with paragraphs of analysis. You wanted one word, not an essay. The fix is not a longer instruction; it is two examples. Show it the exact input-output shape twice and it picks up the pattern.

## What it is

**Few-shot prompting** means putting a handful of worked examples (each an input paired with the exact output you want) directly into the prompt before your real input. The model reads the pattern and continues it. Zero-shot is "just tell it what to do." Few-shot is "show it what done looks like."

This is **in-context learning**: the model adapts to your task from examples in the prompt alone, without any training or weight changes. The examples teach format, tone, edge-case handling, and label vocabulary all at once, things that are awkward to describe in words but easy to demonstrate.

## How it works

A few-shot prompt is built from three parts: an optional instruction, then example pairs, then your real input left open for the model to complete.

\`\`\`python
prompt = (
    "Classify the sentiment as positive or negative.\\n\\n"
    "Review: The food was cold and slow.\\n"
    "Sentiment: negative\\n\\n"
    "Review: Loved every bite, came back twice.\\n"
    "Sentiment: positive\\n\\n"
    "Review: Best meal I've had all year.\\n"
    "Sentiment:"
)
# The model continues the pattern: " positive"
\`\`\`

Notice the model only has to write one more token to fit the established shape. The examples did the heavy lifting of defining the task.

What makes few-shot work *well*:

- **Consistent format.** Every example uses the same labels and layout. Mixed formats confuse the pattern.
- **Cover the edge cases.** If neutral reviews exist, include a neutral example, or the model won't know that label is allowed.
- **Balance the examples.** All-positive examples bias the model toward predicting positive.
- **Order can matter.** Models sometimes lean toward the label of the last example. Shuffle or balance to reduce this.

## Why it matters

Few-shot is the cheapest reliability upgrade you have: no fine-tuning and no infrastructure, just better prompt content.

- **It pins down format** so you can parse the output reliably in code.
- **It teaches by demonstration**, which beats verbose instructions for fuzzy tasks like tone or style.
- **It costs tokens.** Every example sits in the context window on every call, so there is a real trade-off between more examples and prompt size or cost. Two to five good examples usually beats ten mediocre ones.

The classic mistake is unbalanced or sloppy examples. Garbage examples teach the model garbage patterns, confidently.

      title: "Self-Consistency & Voting",
      concept: "Voting",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `A model solves a tricky word problem and answers 42. Run the same prompt again and it answers 27. Run it five more times: 42, 42, 27, 42, 31. Which do you trust? Count them: four of seven say 42, and that majority answer is more reliable than any single run. This is **self-consistency**, and it can lift accuracy several points for the cost of running the prompt a few more times.

## What it is

**Self-consistency** is a pattern where you sample multiple chain-of-thought answers to the same question, then take the **majority vote** of the final answers. Instead of trusting one reasoning path, you generate several diverse paths and let them vote.

It works because a hard problem has many wrong answers but usually one right one. Correct reasoning tends to converge on the same final answer through different routes, while errors scatter. Sample enough paths and the correct answer clusters at the top while mistakes spread thin.

## How it works

The recipe is short:

1. **Set a non-zero temperature** so each run takes a slightly different reasoning path. At temperature zero every run is identical and voting is pointless.
2. **Sample N reasoning chains** for the same prompt (say N = 5).
3. **Extract each final answer** from its chain.
4. **Count and return the most common answer.**

\`\`\`python
from collections import Counter

# final answers pulled from 5 separate CoT runs
answers = [42, 27, 42, 42, 31]
winner = Counter(answers).most_common(1)[0][0]
print(winner)   # 42, the majority, more reliable than any single run
\`\`\`

The reasoning that led to each answer is thrown away after voting; only the final answers compete. You are using disagreement as a signal: when the runs agree, you can be more confident; when they split evenly, the problem is genuinely hard or ambiguous.

## Why it matters

Self-consistency buys accuracy with money and latency rather than a smarter model.

- **It boosts hard-task accuracy** measurably, especially on math and multi-step reasoning where a single chain is fragile.
- **It costs N times the tokens and time.** Five samples means roughly five times the cost. You reserve it for high-value answers, not every query.
- **It needs diversity.** If temperature is too low the paths are near-identical and voting adds nothing; too high and the reasoning degrades. There is a sweet spot.
- **The vote can still be wrong.** If a model has a systematic bias, the majority can be confidently incorrect. Voting reduces random error, not shared bias.

A common upgrade is to weight or filter votes, for example ignoring runs whose reasoning is obviously malformed before counting.

## The mental model to keep

**Ask the same hard question several times and trust the answer that keeps coming back. Agreement across diverse reasoning paths is a confidence signal.**`,

      title: "ReAct & Tool Prompts",
      concept: "ReActPrompt",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Ask a model "What's the weather in Tokyo right now?" and it cannot know, its weights froze months ago. But give it a way to *act*, and it can write "I should check the weather tool," call that tool, read the result, and answer correctly. The pattern that makes this work is **ReAct**: interleaving reasoning with actions.

## What it is

**ReAct** stands for **Reason + Act**. It is a prompting pattern where the model alternates between two kinds of output: a **Thought** (reasoning about what to do next) and an **Action** (calling a tool, like a search, a calculator, or an API). After each action the environment returns an **Observation**, which the model reads before thinking again. The loop is Thought, Action, Observation, repeat, until the model has enough to give a final answer.

This breaks the model out of its frozen, sealed box. Pure reasoning can only work with what's in the prompt and the weights. ReAct lets the model pull in fresh facts, do exact computation, and ground its answer in real tool output instead of guessing.

## How it works

You prompt the model to follow a strict format, then run a loop in your code that watches for actions:

\`\`\`text
Thought: I need the current population of Tokyo.
Action: search("population of Tokyo")
Observation: About 14 million (2024).
Thought: Now I can answer.
Final Answer: Tokyo has about 14 million people.
\`\`\`

Your code does the real work around the model:

1. The model writes a Thought and an Action.
2. Your code **parses the Action**, runs the matching tool, and captures the result.
3. Your code **feeds that result back** as an Observation appended to the prompt.
4. The model reads the Observation and either acts again or writes a Final Answer.

The model never executes anything itself. It only *requests* actions as text; your code is the hands that carry them out and report back.

## Why it matters

ReAct is the backbone of modern AI **agents**: systems that take real actions, not just chat.

- **It grounds answers in real data.** Live weather, current prices, a database row, anything the model couldn't know is fetched, not hallucinated.
- **It offloads exact work.** Math, code execution, and lookups go to tools that don't make arithmetic mistakes.
- **It makes behavior traceable.** The Thought and Action log shows exactly why the system did what it did, which is invaluable for debugging.
- **It adds failure modes.** Tools can error, return junk, or be called with bad arguments. A robust ReAct loop must handle a failed Observation, cap the number of steps, and avoid infinite loops.

## The mental model to keep

      title: "Prompt Chaining & Decomposition",
      concept: "Chaining",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `You ask a model to "read this 20-page report, extract the risks, rank them, and write an executive summary" in one shot. The result is mushy: some risks missed, ranking arbitrary, summary vague. Now split it into four prompts, each doing one job and feeding the next. Suddenly every stage is sharp. That's **prompt chaining**: and it's how serious LLM systems get built.

## What it is

**Prompt chaining** (also called **decomposition**) is breaking a complex task into a sequence of smaller prompts, where the **output of one becomes the input to the next**. Instead of one giant prompt trying to do everything, you build a pipeline of focused steps.

The principle behind it is the same one that makes functions better than one thousand-line script: **a prompt that does one thing does it better.** Each stage has a narrow, clear job, so it's easier to get right, easier to test, and easier to fix when it breaks.

## How it works

Take "summarize the key risks in this report" and decompose it:

\`\`\`text
Step 1  Extract:   "List every risk mentioned in this text." -> raw list
Step 2  Filter:    "Keep only financial and legal risks." -> shorter list
Step 3  Rank:      "Order these risks by severity, worst first." -> ordered list
Step 4  Summarize: "Write a 3-sentence summary of the top 3." -> final output
\`\`\`

In code, you literally feed each result forward:

\`\`\`python
risks   = call_model(extract_prompt(report))
focused = call_model(filter_prompt(risks))
ranked  = call_model(rank_prompt(focused))
summary = call_model(summarize_prompt(ranked))
\`\`\`

Each call is small, inspectable, and independently fixable. If the summary is bad, you can look at \`ranked\` to see whether the problem was the ranking step or the summary step. With one mega-prompt, you'd have no idea which part failed.

Chains can branch and merge too: run several extractions in parallel, then combine them. But the core move is always the same, **split the work, pass the output along.**

## Why it matters

Decomposition is the difference between a demo and a dependable system.

- **Each step is more accurate** because a focused prompt outperforms a sprawling one.
- **The pipeline is debuggable.** You can inspect the intermediate output of every stage and pinpoint exactly where things went wrong.
- **Steps are reusable and swappable.** Improve the ranking prompt without touching the others; reuse the extraction step in a different chain.
- **It costs more calls.** Four prompts mean four round trips, more tokens, and more latency than one. You trade efficiency for reliability and control, usually worth it for anything important.

The risk to watch: **errors compound.** A bad early step poisons everything downstream, so the earliest stages deserve the most care and validation.

## The mental model to keep

      title: "Tree of Thoughts",
      concept: "ToT",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Chain of thought commits to one line of reasoning and rides it to the end. But hard problems often have a first step that *looks* promising and quietly dooms everything after it. **Tree of thoughts (ToT)** fixes that by refusing to commit early: at each step it spawns several candidate continuations, scores them, keeps the best few, and discards the rest. Reasoning stops being a single rope and becomes a branching, self-pruning search.

## What it is

**Tree of thoughts** is a prompting pattern where the model explores **multiple reasoning paths at once**, arranged as a tree. Each node is a partial reasoning state. From any node the model proposes several next "thoughts", the branches. An evaluator scores how promising each branch is, and only the strongest survive to be expanded further. Weak branches are **pruned** so the search doesn't waste effort on dead ends.

Where chain of thought is depth-first and irreversible (one path, no backtracking), ToT is a deliberate search: it can abandon a bad branch and pour effort into a better one. The width of the search, how many branches you keep at each level, is the **beam width**.

## How it works

The loop is propose, evaluate, prune, expand:

\`\`\`python
def tree_of_thoughts(root, beam_width, depth):
    frontier = [root]
    for _ in range(depth):
        candidates = []
        for node in frontier:
            for thought in propose_next(node):     # branch out
                candidates.append((score(thought), thought))
        candidates.sort(reverse=True)              # best first
        frontier = [t for _, t in candidates[:beam_width]]  # prune to top-k
    return best(frontier)
\`\`\`

Two knobs control the search. **Branching factor** is how many candidates each node proposes. **Beam width** is how many you keep after scoring. A beam width of 1 collapses ToT back into greedy chain of thought, you always follow the single best-looking branch and can never recover from a wrong turn. Widen the beam and the search can carry a slightly-weaker-now branch that pays off later.

## Why it matters

ToT shines exactly where a single chain is fragile: puzzles, planning, math with branch points, and any problem where the first move constrains the rest.

- **It escapes early mistakes.** A greedy chain that takes a bad first step is stuck; ToT keeps alternatives alive and can route around the dead end.
- **It costs a lot more.** You run many partial reasonings and score each, so token and latency cost scale with branching factor times depth. Reserve it for genuinely hard problems.
- **It needs a usable evaluator.** Pruning is only as good as the score. A misleading scorer prunes the right branch, and you're worse off than plain CoT.

      title: "Reflection and Self-Critique",
      concept: "Reflection",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `A model writes a function, you ask "are there any bugs in what you just wrote?", and it finds the off-by-one error it created seconds ago. Nothing about the model changed. You simply gave it a second pass, a chance to read its own work with fresh eyes and fix it. That second pass is **reflection**, and it is one of the cheapest quality upgrades you can bolt onto any prompt.

## What it is

**Reflection** (or **self-critique**) is a pattern where the model produces a first answer, then critiques that answer against some standard, and finally revises it. Generation and evaluation become separate steps instead of being crammed into one shot. The model wears two hats in sequence: first the **author**, then the **critic**, then the author again with the critique in hand.

It works for the same reason chain of thought works. A single forward pass that must be correct on the first try is fragile. Splitting it into draft, critique, and revise gives the model explicit room to catch what the draft missed, much like a writer who always edits before publishing.

## How it works

The loop is generate, critique, revise, and optionally repeat:

\`\`\`python
draft = model(task)                                   # 1. author writes
critique = model(f"Find every flaw in this:\\n{draft}")  # 2. critic reviews
final = model(f"Rewrite to fix these issues:\\n{critique}\\n{draft}")  # 3. revise
\`\`\`

The critique step is doing the real work. A vague "make it better" yields little; a sharp critique grounded in concrete criteria, "check each constraint, list every violation", produces fixable, specific feedback. You can run the loop once or iterate until the critic finds nothing left to fix or a step budget runs out.

A crucial detail: the critic should judge against an **external standard** where possible, a spec, a checklist, test results, a tool's output. Asking a model to grade itself with no anchor invites it to rubber-stamp its own work.

## Why it matters

Reflection catches a whole class of errors that one-shot prompting ships straight to the user.

- **It fixes self-made mistakes.** Constraint violations, skipped requirements, sloppy formatting, the critic pass surfaces them before they reach anyone.
- **It costs extra calls.** Draft plus critique plus revise is at least three passes, so reserve it for answers where correctness matters more than latency.
- **It has a ceiling.** The model can only catch flaws it is capable of recognizing. If it didn't know a fact was wrong when it wrote it, it usually won't catch it on review. Reflection sharpens, it does not add knowledge.
- **Anchored critique beats vanity critique.** Grounding the critic in tests, specs, or rules makes the difference between real fixes and the model congratulating itself.

## The mental model to keep

**Never ship the first draft. Make the model put on the critic's hat, judge its own work against a real standard, then revise, author, critic, author again.**`,

      title: "Meta-Prompting",
      concept: "MetaPrompt",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `You've spent this module hand-crafting prompts: adding triggers, balancing examples, wiring chains. Now flip the script. What if you let a model write the prompt for you? Hand it your goal and a few examples, and ask it to produce the best prompt for the job. That is **meta-prompting**: using a model to write or optimize prompts for another task, and it turns prompt engineering itself into something you can automate.

## What it is

**Meta-prompting** is using one model call to generate or improve the prompt that a second call will actually run. The first call's *output* is a prompt; the second call *consumes* that prompt to do the real work. You stop writing the instructions by hand and instead describe what you want, letting the model draft the instructions.

The idea leans on a strength models have: they have read enormous numbers of prompts and know what well-structured instructions look like. Often a model can write a clearer, better-organized prompt than a human typing in a hurry, especially for formatting, edge-case handling, and explicit step-by-step structure.

## How it works

A meta-prompt asks for a prompt as its answer:

\`\`\`python
meta = (
    "Write a clear, reliable prompt that classifies a customer email "
    "as billing, technical, or other. Require a one-word answer. "
    "Include two few-shot examples."
)
generated_prompt = model(meta)     # the model writes the task prompt
result = model(generated_prompt + "\\n" + real_email)  # then we run it
\`\`\`

This unlocks **automatic prompt optimization**: generate several candidate prompts, run each against a small set of labeled examples, score how well each performs, and keep the winner. Prompt engineering becomes a search, propose candidates, evaluate against examples, select the best. It is the same propose-evaluate-select loop you saw in tree of thoughts and self-consistency, now applied to the prompts themselves.

## Why it matters

Meta-prompting scales prompt quality past what hand-tuning can reach.

- **It offloads phrasing and structure** to a model that has seen millions of good prompts, freeing you to specify only the goal.
- **It enables systematic optimization.** Instead of guessing which wording works, you measure candidates against real examples and pick the best objectively.
- **It costs extra calls.** Generating and evaluating candidates burns tokens before the real task even runs, so it pays off most when a prompt will be reused many times.
- **You still need an evaluator.** Picking the best candidate requires a way to score them. Garbage scoring picks garbage prompts, confidently.

## The mental model to keep

**Stop hand-writing every prompt. Describe the goal, let a model draft candidate prompts, measure them against real examples, and keep the winner, prompt engineering as a measurable search.**`,
