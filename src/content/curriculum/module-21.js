      title: "How Pricing Works",
      concept: "Pricing",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `You send a model a one-line question and a dense three-page answer comes back. When the bill arrives, those three pages cost far more than your one line, and not only because they are longer. Once you see how LLM pricing works, the invoice stops surprising you.

## What it is

An LLM API doesn't charge per request or per minute. It charges per token, the small chunks of text the model reads and writes. Every call has two token counts: the input tokens (your prompt, plus any history) and the output tokens (the model's reply). They are priced separately, and that split drives the cost.

Prices are quoted per million tokens. You'll see a model listed like "$3 / 1M input, $15 / 1M output." The word "million" can look alarming, but most single calls use a few hundred to a few thousand tokens, so a call costs a fraction of a cent. The per-million number is a compact way to write a very small per-token price.

## How it works

Two facts drive every bill:

1. Input and output are billed at different rates. The same provider that charges \\$3 per million input tokens might charge \\$15 per million output tokens. Reading your prompt is cheap; generating new text is expensive.
2. Output is usually several times more expensive than input. A 3x to 5x gap is common. The model works harder to produce tokens than to read them, and pricing reflects that.

To find a call's cost, compute each side and add them:

\`\`\`python
input_tokens = 1000
output_tokens = 500
input_price = 3   # dollars per 1,000,000 input tokens
output_price = 15  # dollars per 1,000,000 output tokens

input_cost = input_tokens / 1_000_000 * input_price
output_cost = output_tokens / 1_000_000 * output_price
total = input_cost + output_cost
print(f"total: \${total:.6f}")
\`\`\`

## Why it matters

Because output is the pricey side, a model that writes long answers can cost more than one with a longer, denser prompt. If you want to control spend, the first lever is usually the length of the answer, not the length of the question.

      title: "Estimating Cost Before You Call",
      concept: "Estimation",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `You're about to wire an AI feature into your app that fires on every page load. Before you ship it, one question should keep you up at night: what will this cost when ten thousand people use it? You don't need to guess. You can estimate the cost of a call *before* you ever make it.

## What it is

Cost estimation is a two-step trick. First, **estimate the token count** from the text you have. Second, **plug those tokens into the price** to get an expected dollar figure. Do this before launch and the invoice never surprises you.

The token estimate uses the rough rule from the basics: **about 1 token per 4 characters** of English. It isn't exact, the real tokenizer is, but it's close enough to budget with. Count characters, divide by four, round up.

## How it works

Say you have a prompt and an expected answer length:

\`\`\`python
import math

prompt = "Summarize this paragraph in one sentence."
est_input_tokens = math.ceil(len(prompt) / 4)   # ~chars / 4
est_output_tokens = 60                            # you decide a budget for the reply

input_price = 3    # $/1M
output_price = 15  # $/1M
cost = (est_input_tokens / 1_000_000 * input_price
        + est_output_tokens / 1_000_000 * output_price)
print(f"estimated cost: \${cost:.6f}")
\`\`\`

For output you usually can't measure ahead of time, so you **assume a budget**: "I'll cap the answer at 200 tokens", and price against that. That assumption is also a spending limit you can later enforce.

## Why it matters

The real power is multiplying by scale. One call at \\$0.0002 sounds free. The same call **100,000 times a day** is \\$20 a day, \\$600 a month. Estimating per-call cost and multiplying by expected volume turns a vague worry into a number you can plan around, and a number you can compare against alternatives before you commit.

## The mental model to keep

**Tokens first, then dollars, then multiply by volume.** A five-line estimate beats a five-figure surprise.`,

      title: "Where the Money Goes",
      concept: "Cost Drivers",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `A team launches a chatbot, watches the first few messages cost almost nothing, and relaxes. Three weeks later the bill is ten times what they modeled. Nothing broke. They just didn't see where the money actually goes in a real conversation, and it's almost never where beginners expect.

## What it is

Two things dominate a real LLM bill, and neither is the obvious "the prompt is long."

1. **Long outputs.** Output tokens cost several times more than input, so an answer that rambles is the single biggest controllable cost on any one call.
2. **Chat history that compounds.** This is the sneaky one. A model is stateless, it remembers nothing between calls. To fake a conversation, the app **resends the entire transcript every single turn**. Turn 10 doesn't just send your latest message; it re-sends turns 1 through 9 as input, plus the new message.

## How it works

That resending makes input cost grow with every turn. If each turn adds about the same number of tokens, the running input total climbs like 1, then 1+2, then 1+2+3, the transcript gets re-billed again and again:

\`\`\`python
tokens_per_turn = 100  # rough size of each message
total_input_tokens = 0
for turn in range(1, 6):
    # the whole transcript so far is resent as input this turn
    history_tokens = tokens_per_turn * turn
    total_input_tokens += history_tokens
    print(f"turn {turn}: resend {history_tokens} input tokens")
print("cumulative input tokens:", total_input_tokens)
\`\`\`

By turn 20 of a long chat, you might be paying to resend nineteen earlier messages on every reply. The conversation didn't get smarter; it just got more expensive to carry.

## Why it matters

This explains the two classic bill shocks: a feature that lets the model write long answers, and a chat product where long sessions cost far more than short ones. Both are fixable, but only once you can name the culprit. Spotting *where* the money goes is the prerequisite for cutting it, which is the next lesson.

## The mental model to keep

**Output is expensive per token; history is expensive by repetition.** Watch the answers you allow and the transcript you keep resending.`,

      concept: "Optimization",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `You've found where the money goes: long outputs and a transcript that gets re-billed every turn. Now the satisfying part, there are a handful of simple levers that can quietly cut a bill by half or more, without making the product worse. Most teams reach for an expensive model when a few of these would have done it.

## What it is

Four practical levers, roughly in order of how often they help:

1. **Trim or summarize history.** Don't resend the entire transcript forever. Keep the last few turns, or replace old turns with a short summary. This directly attacks the compounding-input problem from the last lesson.
2. **Cap max output.** Set a limit on how many tokens the reply can use. Since output is the expensive side, a sensible cap is the highest-leverage single setting.
3. **Use prompt caching.** If the same big chunk (a long system prompt, a fixed document) is sent on every call, providers can **cache** it so repeats are billed at a steep discount instead of full price.
4. **Choose a smaller, cheaper model.** When the task is easy, classification, short rewrites, simple extraction, a smaller model often does it fine for a fraction of the price. Save the big model for when quality truly needs it.

## How it works

These levers reduce the token counts (or their price) on each side of the bill. For example, trimming history from 10 resent turns down to the last 3:

\`\`\`python
tokens_per_turn = 100
full_history = tokens_per_turn * 10   # resend everything
trimmed_history = tokens_per_turn * 3 # keep only the last 3 turns
saved = full_history - trimmed_history
print(f"saved {saved} input tokens this turn")  # saved 700 input tokens this turn
\`\`\`

## Why it matters

The order matters: history trimming and an output cap are free to apply and hit the two biggest drivers head-on. Caching helps when you repeat a large fixed prefix. Model choice is the heaviest hammer, huge savings, but only when the smaller model's quality is good enough for the job. Reach for the cheap levers first; downgrade the model last, and only after checking it still works.

## The mental model to keep

      title: "Input vs Output Cost",
      concept: "Pricing",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Two engineers send the model the same 4,000 tokens. One puts almost all of it in the prompt and asks for a one-word answer. The other sends a tiny prompt and lets the model write a 4,000-token essay. Identical token totals, wildly different bills. The second call can cost five times the first. That gap has a name: **asymmetric pricing**.

## What it is

LLM pricing is **asymmetric**: input tokens and output tokens are billed at *different* rates, and output is almost always the expensive side. A common pattern is something like \\$3 per million input tokens against \\$15 per million output tokens, a clean **5x** gap. The provider charges more to *generate* text than to *read* it.

This means the token total alone tells you almost nothing. A call's cost depends on *which side* the tokens land on. Shift tokens from output to input and the same workload gets cheaper.

## How it works

Cost is two products added together, never one flat per-token rate:

\`\`\`python
input_tokens = 3000
output_tokens = 800
input_price = 3     # dollars per 1,000,000 input tokens
output_price = 15   # dollars per 1,000,000 output tokens

input_cost = input_tokens / 1_000_000 * input_price
output_cost = output_tokens / 1_000_000 * output_price
total = input_cost + output_cost

print(f"input:  \${input_cost:.6f}")
print(f"output: \${output_cost:.6f}")   # bigger, even with fewer tokens
print(f"total:  \${total:.6f}")
\`\`\`

Here 3,000 input tokens cost \\$0.009, but just 800 output tokens cost \\$0.012, fewer tokens, higher cost, because each output token is priced 5x higher.

## Why it matters

The asymmetry flips your intuition about where to optimize. A bloated prompt feels wasteful, but it's billed on the *cheap* meter. A model that rambles a long answer is billed on the *expensive* meter. So the highest-leverage knob is usually **how much the model writes**, not how much you send. If your bill surprises you, do the input-versus-output split first, it almost always points straight at the output side.

## The mental model to keep

      title: "Caching to Cut Cost",
      concept: "Caching",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `You ship a support bot with a 2,000-token system prompt: rules, tone, a product FAQ. Every single message resends that same 2,000 tokens as input. Across a million messages you pay full price for the identical text two million... no, a billion times. Prompt caching exists to stop exactly this waste - and it can cut a repeated prefix's cost by **90%**.

## What it is

**Prompt caching** lets the provider store a fixed prefix of your input - usually the long, unchanging part - and bill it at a steep discount on later calls instead of full price. The discount is large: a cached token often costs around **10% of the normal input rate**. The catch is that only a **cacheable prefix** qualifies: the part of the prompt that is byte-for-byte identical, sitting at the very front, call after call.

## How it works

You mark the stable front of the prompt - the system prompt, a fixed document - as cacheable. The first call pays full price (and sometimes a small write fee) to populate the cache. Every later call that starts with the exact same prefix reads it at the discounted rate, and only the *new* part (the user's actual question) is billed at full input price:

\`\`\`python
prefix_tokens = 2000     # the fixed system prompt, sent every call
new_tokens = 50          # the user's question, different each call
input_price = 3          # $/1M, full rate
cache_rate = 0.10        # cached tokens cost 10% of full rate

full = (prefix_tokens + new_tokens) / 1_000_000 * input_price
cached = (prefix_tokens * cache_rate + new_tokens) / 1_000_000 * input_price
print(f"full:   \${full:.6f}")
print(f"cached: \${cached:.6f}")   # the 2000-token prefix is now 90% off
\`\`\`

The bigger and more repeated the prefix, the more caching saves. A tiny prefix that changes every call cannot be cached at all.

## Why it matters

Caching turns a fixed overhead into near-zero. If 90% of your input is a stable instruction block, caching can drop your input bill by most of that block's cost without changing a word of behavior. It is the rare lever that is free to quality: the model sees the exact same prompt either way. The only requirement is keeping that prefix **stable** - reorder or edit it and you bust the cache, paying full price again.

## The mental model to keep

**Pay full price for the fixed prefix once, then read it at a discount forever - as long as you never change it.**`,

      explanation: `You have a nightly job: summarize 100,000 documents before the morning report. Run them through the normal real-time API and you pay full rate and watch progress bars all evening. Send them to the **batch API** instead and the same work is billed at **half price** - the catch is it might take a few hours to come back. For an overnight job, that trade is a steal.

## What it is

The **batch API** is a discounted lane for work that does not need an instant answer. You submit a big pile of requests at once, the provider processes them whenever it has spare capacity, and you get all the results back within a turnaround window (often up to a day). In exchange for giving up immediacy, you get a flat discount - commonly around **50% off** both input and output - on the whole batch.

The trade is **latency for price**. Real-time gets you an answer in seconds at full cost; batch gets you the answer in minutes-to-hours at a fraction of the cost.

## How it works

The decision is per-job: does this task tolerate the batch turnaround? If yes, route it to batch and apply the discount. If a job needs a fast answer (a user is waiting), it stays on the real-time lane at full price:

\`\`\`python
discount = 0.50            # batch is 50% off
batch_turnaround = 60      # minutes the batch lane may take
job_tolerance = 240        # this job can wait up to 240 minutes
cost = 9000                # full-price numerator for this job

if job_tolerance >= batch_turnaround:
    billed = cost * (1 - discount)   # eligible for batch: half price
else:
    billed = cost                    # must run real-time: full price
print("billed numerator:", billed)
\`\`\`

So a job that can wait pays half; a job that cannot wait pays full. Sorting your workload into "can wait" and "cannot wait" is the whole optimization.

## Why it matters

Most workloads are a mix. The user-facing chat must be real-time. But the analytics, the bulk classification, the offline summaries, the eval runs - none of those need a human-speed reply, and they are often the *bulk* of the token volume. Moving that bulk to the batch lane can halve a huge slice of the bill while the latency-sensitive part stays fast. The skill is recognizing which jobs are secretly patient.

## The mental model to keep

**If no human is waiting, send it to the slow lane and pay half. Trade time you do not need for money you do.**`,

      title: "Budgets and Spend Alerts",
      concept: "Budgets",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `A startup wired GPT into a free trial and went to bed. One user wrote a script that hammered the endpoint all night. By morning the bill was \\$11,000 - for a product that earned \\$0. There was no spending cap, no per-user limit, no alert. Every cost lever in this module shrinks the *average* call; budgets and alerts protect you from the *runaway* call. They are the seatbelt.

## What it is

Three controls turn estimates into guardrails:

1. **Spend caps.** A hard ceiling on total spend (per day or per month). Cross it and further calls are refused. This bounds your worst case to a number you chose, not a number an attacker chose.
2. **Per-user budgets.** A separate cap for each user, so one person cannot drain the whole account. Track each user's running spend and reject calls that would push them over their own limit.
3. **Spend alerts.** A warning fired *before* you hit the cap - say at 80% of budget - so a human can react while there is still room, instead of discovering the problem from the invoice.

## How it works

Each cap is a running total compared against a limit. Per user, you accumulate cost and refuse the call that would breach the budget; you fire one alert when crossing the warning threshold:

\`\`\`python
cap = 10000          # this user's budget, in micro-dollars (cost x 1e6)
alert_at = 0.80      # warn at 80% of cap
spent = 7800         # already spent this period
new_call = 1800      # cost of the next call

if spent + new_call > cap:
    print("BLOCKED: would exceed budget")
else:
    spent += new_call
    if spent >= cap * alert_at:
        print("ALERT: crossed 80% of budget")
    print("spent so far:", spent)
\`\`\`

The cap **stops** the spend; the alert **warns** before the cap. You want both - a wall and a tripwire in front of it.

## Why it matters

Estimation tells you what a call *should* cost; it cannot stop abuse, bugs, or a retry loop gone wild. A single misbehaving client can generate cost faster than any human notices. Caps bound the damage to a chosen ceiling; per-user budgets keep one bad actor from starving everyone else; alerts buy you reaction time. Together they convert "we hope it stays cheap" into "it cannot exceed X, and we hear about it at 0.8X."

## The mental model to keep

**Estimate to plan, cap to survive, alert to react. A budget you do not enforce is just a wish.**`,
