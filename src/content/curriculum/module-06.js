      title: "Words as Coordinates",
      concept: "Vectors",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Your phone's autocomplete knows "cat" and "kitten" are related but "cat" and "car" aren't, even though "cat" and "car" share more letters. How? It doesn't read letters. It reads numbers. The word "cat" becomes something like \`[4, 1]\` and the machine compares those numbers, not the spelling.

## What a vector is

A **vector** is just an ordered list of numbers. Picture every word as a dot on a map. "cat" lives at coordinates \`[4, 1]\`. "kitten" lives nearby at \`[3, 1]\`. "car" is way off at \`[1, 5]\`. That list of coordinates is the vector. The map can have 2 dimensions like here, or 1,536 dimensions like a real embedding model. Same idea, more axes.

The core idea of embeddings is one sentence: **place similar things close together and different things far apart.** Once meaning lives as coordinates, "find related words" turns into "find nearby dots," which is just arithmetic.

## How you compare two vectors

You need two tools, and you build each one once:

- **Dot product**, multiply matching components, then add them up. \`[4,1] · [3,1] = 4*3 + 1*1 = 13\`. A bigger result roughly means the two arrows point in a similar direction.
- **Magnitude**, the length of the arrow from the origin to the dot. \`|[4,1]| = sqrt(4² + 1²) = sqrt(17) ≈ 4.123\`. This is just the Pythagorean theorem, extended to any number of axes.

Both reduce to the same Python pattern: walk two lists in lockstep with \`zip\`, do a little math per pair, and \`sum\` the result.

\`\`\`python
import math

cat = [4, 1]
kitten = [3, 1]
print(sum(x * y for x, y in zip(cat, kitten)))  # dot product -> 13
\`\`\`

That \`zip\` pattern shows up constantly across this whole module. Lock it in now.

## Why it matters

Representing words as coordinates is what makes meaning *computable*. Search, recommendations, spam filters, and retrieval for chatbots all start by turning text into vectors so a CPU can rank "closeness" billions of times a second. You could instead store raw spelling, but spelling tells you nothing: "cat" and "car" differ by one letter yet mean unrelated things, while "cat" and "feline" share zero letters yet mean almost the same thing. Numbers placed by meaning fix that.

There is a subtlety, though. You could measure plain straight-line (**Euclidean**) distance between two dots, the same Pythagorean idea as magnitude, but applied to the *gap* between two vectors: \`distance(a, b) = sqrt(sum((a_i - b_i)²))\`. For example, the distance from \`[0,0]\` to \`[3,4]\` is \`sqrt(3² + 4²) = sqrt(25) = 5\`. Sometimes that is fine. But for text, **direction usually matters more than length**. A long document about cats and a one-line tweet about cats should count as similar even though one vector is much "longer." That tension is exactly what the next lesson resolves with the angle between vectors.

## The mental model to keep

A vector is a word's address on a map of meaning. Comparing words is just measuring how their addresses relate, and you only ever need two tools to do it: dot product and magnitude.`,

      title: "Cosine Similarity",
      concept: "Cosine",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Here is the problem with dot product alone: a vector that is just *longer* scores higher even when it points the same way. A 2,000-word essay about cars and a quick "I love cars" tweet should rank as equally car-ish. Raw dot product punishes the tweet for being short. The fix is to throw away length and keep only **direction**. That is cosine similarity.

## What it is

**Cosine similarity** is the cosine of the angle between two vectors. Two arrows pointing the same way have a 0-degree angle, and cos(0) = 1. Two arrows at right angles have a 90-degree angle, and cos(90) = 0. The score tells you alignment, and alignment is exactly what "similar meaning" looks like on the map.

## How it works

You already wrote \`dot\` and \`magnitude\` last lesson. Cosine glues them together:

\`\`\`
cosine(a, b) = dot(a, b) / (magnitude(a) * magnitude(b))
\`\`\`

Dividing the dot product by both magnitudes cancels out the length of each vector. What survives is purely the angle between them. Step by step: compute the raw alignment with the dot product, then divide away how long each arrow happens to be, and you are left with the cosine of the angle.

\`\`\`python
def cosine(a, b):
    return dot(a, b) / (magnitude(a) * magnitude(b))
\`\`\`

Reading the score is simple:

- **1.0**, same direction. Basically synonyms.
- **0.0**, perpendicular. Unrelated.
- **-1.0**, opposite. Rare with real text embeddings, which usually land between 0 and 1.

So when you compute \`cosine(die_hard, mad_max) = 0.99\` and \`cosine(die_hard, notebook) = 0.26\`, the model is telling you Die Hard and Mad Max are nearly the same flavor of movie, and The Notebook is a different world.

## Why it matters

Cosine similarity is the workhorse of search, recommendations, RAG retrieval, and duplicate detection. Almost every "find me things like this" feature you have ever used runs cosine, or a close cousin, under the hood. It wins over plain dot product because real text varies wildly in length: a product description, a one-line review, and a full article about the same item should all match a query, and only an angle-based measure treats them fairly. Learn it once, recognize it everywhere.

One gotcha to respect: if a vector is all zeros, its magnitude is zero and you divide by zero. Real embedding models never return a zero vector, but hand-built vectors can, so guard against it when you craft vectors yourself.

## The mental model to keep

Dot product asks "how much do these overlap, length included?" Cosine asks "ignoring size, are they pointing the same way?" For meaning, the second question is almost always the one you want answered.`,

      title: "Normalize Once, Compare Fast",
      concept: "Normalization",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Say you have got 10,000 movies and a user picks one. You want the closest matches, fast. Computing cosine the naive way recalculates two square-root magnitudes for *every* comparison. That is wasteful, and it gets brutal at a million vectors. Production search engines all use the same trick.

## What it is

To **normalize** a vector, divide every component by its magnitude. The result points the exact same direction but has length 1. A vector with length exactly 1 is called a **unit vector**.

\`\`\`python
def normalize(v):
    m = magnitude(v)
    return [x / m for x in v]
\`\`\`

Take \`[3, 4]\`. Its magnitude is 5. Normalized, it becomes \`[0.6, 0.8]\`. Check the length: \`sqrt(0.6² + 0.8²) = sqrt(0.36 + 0.64) = sqrt(1) = 1\`. Same direction, length rescaled to one.

## How it works (and why it speeds things up)

Recall cosine is \`dot(a, b) / (mag(a) * mag(b))\`. If both vectors are already normalized, both magnitudes are 1, so dividing by them changes nothing. The whole formula collapses:

\`\`\`
cosine(a, b) = dot(a, b)        # when a and b are unit vectors
\`\`\`

That is the payoff. **Normalize your entire database once, up front, at index time.** After that, every query is a plain dot product, no square roots in the hot loop, no per-comparison magnitude work. For a million-vector index, that is the difference between a fast search and a slow one. This is precisely why real vector databases store normalized embeddings, and some embedding APIs even return pre-normalized vectors so you can skip the step entirely.

## Why it matters

Normalization is a classic **precompute** move: do the expensive work once and store the result so repeated queries stay cheap. A few things to keep straight:

- Normalizing a **zero vector** divides by zero, the same trap as cosine. Guard it.
- After normalizing, the raw numbers look small (all between -1 and 1). That is expected, not a bug.
- The angle between two vectors does not change when you normalize. You are only rescaling length, never rotating, so all your similarity scores stay identical.

Prove it to yourself: compute cosine the long way, then normalize both vectors and take a bare dot product. Same answer. That equivalence is the entire reason normalization is worth doing.

## The mental model to keep

Normalize once at index time so every search becomes a single fast dot product. You trade a bit of upfront work for cheap queries forever after.`,

      title: "Build the Movie Recommender",
      concept: "Recommender",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `The "Because you watched Die Hard..." row on every streaming service is cosine similarity over movie vectors, and you now have every piece to build it.

## What a recommender is

A **recommender** ranks items by similarity to something a user already likes. There is no magic: it turns "what should I watch next?" into "which vectors point closest to the vector of what you just watched?" The seed is the item you are finding neighbors for, and the answer is the nearest few vectors.

## How it works

The recipe is four steps:

1. Give each movie a vector. Real systems learn these from viewing data; here we hand-craft genre scores so you can read them.
2. To recommend for a movie, compute cosine similarity from its vector to every other movie.
3. Sort the results descending.
4. Take the top N, that is the list.

Our vectors have five dimensions: \`[action, romance, comedy, scifi, drama]\`, each from 0 to 1. Die Hard is heavy action, light everything else. Interstellar leans sci-fi and drama. The math surfaces the right neighbors.

\`\`\`python
def recommend(title, n=3):
    target = movies[title]
    scored = [(name, cosine(target, vec))
              for name, vec in movies.items()
              if name != title]
    scored.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])
    return scored[:n]
\`\`\`

That \`if name != title\` is not optional. A movie is always perfectly similar to itself (cosine 1.0), so recommending Die Hard to a Die Hard fan would top the list while being useless. Always exclude the **seed item**.

## Why it matters

You could instead just filter by a single genre label, but movies are blends. Blade Runner is sci-fi *and* action *and* noir-drama at once. A vector captures that mix in one shot, so it finds Interstellar (another sci-fi/drama lean) even though their top genre tag differs. Tags cannot do that without a tangle of if-statements, and the tangle grows with every new genre. Vectors scale; rule-based tags do not.

There is one more move that makes this production-ready. A real user likes several movies, not one. The standard trick: **average their liked vectors** into a single **taste vector**, then find the nearest movies to that average. One vector, one search, captures the blend of everything they enjoy, that is the challenge below.

## The mental model to keep

Embed, compare with cosine, sort, return top N. That same four-step skeleton powers movie recommendations, document search, RAG retrieval, and duplicate detection. Different data, identical machinery.`,

      title: "Real Embeddings & Semantic Search",
      concept: "Semantic search",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Our movie vectors were hand-written. That does not scale to 10,000 movies or to free-form text like support tickets. For real text you call an **embedding model**: send it a string, get back a vector of floats. Then the exact same cosine-and-sort code you have been writing all module works on anything.

## What it is

An **embedding model** converts text into a fixed-length vector of floats that represents its meaning. **Semantic search** is finding documents by meaning rather than exact words, using those vectors and cosine similarity. The two ideas are inseparable: the model gives you the coordinates, cosine ranks the closeness.

## How it works, and where keyword search breaks

Old-school search matches literal words. Type "I forgot my password and can't sign in" and a keyword engine finds the doc containing "password." But it completely misses "My login isn't working anymore" because that doc shares *zero* words with your query. Same meaning, different vocabulary, and keyword search is blind to it.

Embeddings fix this. A good model places "sign in," "login," and "log in" near each other in vector space because it learned from data that they mean the same thing. So semantic search retrieves the login doc even with no shared words. Calling the model is conceptually one HTTP request:

\`\`\`python
import os
import requests

def embed(text):
    resp = requests.post(
        "https://api.example-embeddings.com/v1/embed",
        headers={"Authorization": "Bearer " + os.environ["EMBEDDING_API_KEY"]},
        json={"model": "text-embedding-3", "input": text},
    )
    return resp.json()["data"][0]["embedding"]  # e.g. 1536 floats
\`\`\`

**Never hardcode the key.** Read it from \`os.environ\`. Committed keys get scraped off GitHub within minutes. The vector that comes back is just a longer version of what you have used all module.

From there the loop is four steps:

1. Embed every document once, up front. Store the vectors.
2. Embed the user's query when it arrives.
3. Cosine-similarity the query against every stored vector.
4. Sort and return the top results.

## Why it matters

This is the engine behind modern search and **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): you embed your documents, retrieve the relevant ones by similarity, and feed them to an LLM as grounded context. Done once at index time, document embeddings are reused across every query, so only the short query is embedded fresh, that is what keeps it fast and cheap at scale. The runnable code below uses pre-stored vectors so it is deterministic with no network call, but the logic is identical to production. Watch the payoff: the query has no words in common with "My login isn't working anymore," yet that doc still ranks second. Keyword search can never pull that off.

## The mental model to keep

The model turns text into coordinates; cosine ranks the coordinates. Embed once, query forever, and you have semantic search that understands meaning instead of matching spelling.`,

      title: "Embedding Dimensions: What They Capture",
      concept: "Dimensions",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `All module long the vectors were tiny: two or three numbers. Real embeddings are far larger. A common text model returns **1,536 floats per string**, and the big ones push past 3,000. Why on earth do you need three thousand numbers to represent the word "dog"? Because each number is a separate **axis of meaning**, and meaning has far more than two or three sides.

## What it is

Every slot in an embedding is a **dimension**, one independent direction the model can use to place a word. In the toy \`[action, romance]\` movie space you had exactly two axes, so every movie was pinned by just two facts. Real text has thousands of facts that matter at once: tense, formality, topic, sentiment, is-it-a-question, is-it-code, language, and many the model invented that have no human name. Each gets its own dimension.

The headline idea: **more dimensions means more room to keep different meanings apart.** With two axes, "bank" the riverbank and "bank" the money place are forced near each other. With a thousand axes, the model has space to separate them along the dimensions that actually distinguish them.

## How it works

A trained model does not assign axes by hand. It learns them, and remarkable structure falls out. Some directions end up encoding clean concepts, a "royalty" direction, a "plural" direction, a "past tense" direction. The famous demo: take the vector for "king," subtract a "male" direction, add a "female" direction, and you land near "queen." Meaning becomes arithmetic on axes.

\`\`\`python
# Each axis is one semantic direction. Find a word's dominant one.
king = [0.9, 0.1, 0.8, -0.2]   # axes: [royalty, gender, power, edible]
dominant_axis = max(range(len(king)), key=lambda i: abs(king[i]))
print(dominant_axis)  # 0 -> 'royalty' is this word's strongest signal
\`\`\`

You almost never read individual axes in production, most are uninterpretable blends. But the principle holds: each dimension is a knob, and a word's vector is the full setting of every knob at once.

## Why it matters

Dimension count is a real engineering trade-off, not a "bigger is better" knob:

- **Too few dimensions** crowd unrelated meanings together, so the model confuses words it should keep apart. Quality drops.
- **More dimensions** buy room to separate fine distinctions, but every extra axis costs memory and makes each cosine comparison slower. A million 3,072-float vectors is a lot of RAM.
- That is why models offer a few sizes, and some let you **truncate** a long embedding to a shorter one when you would rather have speed than the last drop of accuracy.

## The mental model to keep

A dimension is one axis of meaning, and an embedding is a word's position along every axis at once. More axes give the model more room to keep different meanings apart, at a cost in memory and compute you pay on every single comparison.`,

      title: "Chunking Before Embedding",
      concept: "Chunking",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Try to embed an entire 80-page manual as one string and the result is useless. The model averages everything into one fuzzy vector that points nowhere in particular, and your search returns the whole manual for every query. The fix is the unglamorous step that quietly decides whether a RAG system works at all: **chunking**. Split the document into bite-sized pieces first, then embed each piece on its own.

## What it is

**Chunking** is breaking a long document into smaller passages, called **chunks**, before embedding, so each vector represents one focused idea instead of a blur of many. A chunk might be a paragraph, a few sentences, or a fixed number of words. Each chunk gets its own embedding and its own row in the index. When a query comes in, you retrieve the matching chunks, not whole documents.

## How it works

The simplest scheme is fixed-size: pack words into a chunk until you hit a size cap, then start a new chunk. Greedy and predictable.

\`\`\`python
def chunk_words(words, max_size):
    chunks, current = [], []
    for w in words:
        if len(current) + 1 > max_size:   # would overflow -> close the chunk
            chunks.append(current)
            current = [w]
        else:
            current.append(w)
    if current:
        chunks.append(current)
    return chunks
\`\`\`

Two dials control quality. **Chunk size** sets how much meaning each vector carries: too big and the vector blurs many topics together; too small and a single idea gets split across chunks so neither one is complete. A few hundred tokens is a common sweet spot. **Overlap** repeats a little text between neighboring chunks so a sentence that straddles a boundary is not cut in half, the answer to a query is never stranded between two chunks. Smarter schemes split on natural seams (paragraphs, headings, sentences) instead of blindly counting words, so a chunk rarely begins mid-thought.

## Why it matters

Chunking is where most RAG quality is won or lost, well before any fancy model is chosen:

- **Retrieval precision.** Small, focused chunks let cosine pinpoint the exact passage that answers a query, instead of dragging back an entire document.
- **Context limits.** You feed retrieved chunks to an LLM, and its context window is finite. Tight chunks mean you can fit more *relevant* passages instead of one bloated blob.
- **Cost.** You embed every chunk once. Sane chunk sizes keep the vector count, storage, and embedding bill reasonable rather than exploding.

Get chunking wrong and no amount of model quality saves you: the right answer simply never surfaces, because it was blurred into a giant vector or sliced clean in half.

## The mental model to keep

Embed ideas, not documents. Chunk a long text into focused passages first, tune the size so each vector carries exactly one clear thought, and let a little overlap keep ideas from being cut at the seams.`,

      title: "Caching and Updating Embeddings",
      concept: "Lifecycle",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Embedding is not free. Every call to the model costs money and milliseconds, and a real knowledge base has millions of chunks that mostly never change. Re-embedding all of them on every deploy would waste both your budget and your latency. So production systems treat embeddings as a **cache you maintain over time**, not a thing you compute once and forget. This lesson is the unglamorous lifecycle work that keeps a vector index correct and cheap.

## What it is

The **embedding lifecycle** is the set of rules for storing vectors, deciding when to recompute them, and keeping the index in sync with the source text. The core principle: **a chunk's embedding is valid exactly as long as its text is unchanged.** Cache the vector keyed to the text. If the text never changes, never re-embed it.

## How it works

The standard trick is a **content hash**. Hash each chunk's text; store the vector alongside that hash. On the next pass, re-hash the current text and compare:

\`\`\`python
def needs_reembed(chunk_id, text, cache):
    h = hash_text(text)                 # cheap, local, no API call
    if cache.get(chunk_id) != h:        # missing or text changed
        cache[chunk_id] = h
        return True                     # re-embed: pay for the API call
    return False                        # hash matches -> reuse stored vector
\`\`\`

If the hash matches, the text is byte-for-byte the same, so the old vector is still correct and you skip the expensive call. If it differs, the source changed and the stored vector is now **stale**, recompute it. This makes updates **incremental**: edit ten chunks out of a million and you embed ten, not a million.

One more piece keeps you safe across model upgrades: the **index version**. When you switch to a new embedding model, every old vector is meaningless because vectors from different models are not comparable. Stamp the index with a model version; when it changes, re-embed everything once and bump the version. Mixing two models' vectors in one index silently corrupts every similarity score.

## Why it matters

This is the difference between a demo and a system that survives contact with real, changing data:

- **Cost and speed.** Cache hits cost nothing. Only changed chunks hit the API, so updates stay fast and cheap at scale.
- **Correctness.** Stale vectors silently return wrong results, the index says one thing, the document says another. Hash checks catch exactly the chunks that drifted.
- **Safe migrations.** Versioning the index means a model upgrade never leaves you comparing apples to oranges across two embedding spaces.

## The mental model to keep

An embedding is a cached function of its text. Re-embed only when the text's hash changes, and version the whole index whenever the model changes. Compute once, reuse forever, recompute exactly when something actually moved.`,

Storing a hash of each chunk's text lets the system re-hash on the next pass and compare: if the hash matches, the text is identical and the cached vector is still correct, so it is reused for free. Only the chunks whose hash changed get re-embedded. The hash turns a full rebuild into a cheap incremental update that touches exactly what moved."
