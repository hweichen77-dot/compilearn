      title: "The Model Has Amnesia",
      concept: "Message History",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `When you first call an LLM, the model forgets everything the instant it finishes replying. You send "My name is Sam." It says "Nice to meet you, Sam." You send "What's my name?" and it cannot answer. The model has no record of what you told it a moment ago.

## What message history is

Each API call is a fresh start. The model didn't store your name anywhere; it can't. There's no database behind the scenes remembering you. The model is **stateless**: it keeps nothing between calls.

So a chatbot that remembers is an illusion you build. The tool you build it with is **message history**: the running list of everything said so far, which you resend on every call. The model re-reads the whole thing each turn and answers as if it remembered. The "memory" is just a Python list you keep adding to.

## How it works

The Messages API takes a list. Each item is a dict with two keys, a \`role\` and \`content\`:

\`\`\`python
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "My name is Sam."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nice to meet you, Sam."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's my name?"},
]
\`\`\`

The \`role\` labels who said it: **user** for the human, **assistant** for the model. Roles alternate (user, assistant, user, assistant), and the list must start with a user turn. A working chatbot is four steps in a loop:

1. Read what the user typed.
2. Append it as a \`user\` turn.
3. Call the API with the **whole list**, not just the newest line.
4. Append the reply as an \`assistant\` turn, print it, repeat.

Every loop the list grows by two. That growing list *is* the memory.

## Why it matters

Most beginner chatbots feel broken because they only send the latest message and wonder why the bot is goldfish-brained. Once you see that memory is your job, several consequences follow:

- **You pay for it.** Resending the whole history every turn means a 40-turn chat sends all 40 turns on turn 41. Long conversations get expensive, which is why a later lesson trims history.
- **You can edit it.** Because *you* own the list, you can delete a bad turn, inject a fact, or reset the chat by clearing the list. The model never objects.
- **Order and roles matter.** Two user turns in a row, or starting with an assistant turn, gets rejected by the API. Always append the assistant reply before the next user turn.

Build the message list by hand first and simulate the back-and-forth, no real API yet. Get the data shape right; the network call is the easy part.

## The mental model to keep

The model has amnesia, but it can read a whiteboard. Each turn you hand it the **entire whiteboard** of the conversation, it reads top to bottom, and writes one more line. Lose the whiteboard, lose the memory.`,

      concept: "System Prompt",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `You want a pirate. Or a grumpy medieval blacksmith. Or a chipper golden retriever who happens to know Python. You could stuff "act like a pirate" into a user message, and it works, for about three turns, then the bot quietly slides back into a neutral assistant. There's a better tool built for exactly this job.

## What the system prompt is

The **system prompt** is a separate instruction string that sets the model's persona, tone, and hard rules. In the Anthropic Messages API, the persona does **not** go inside the \`messages\` list. It rides in its own top-level \`system\` parameter:

\`\`\`python
client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    max_tokens=300,
    system="You are Captain Reddbeard, a 1600s pirate. Speak in pirate dialect. Never break character.",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like?"}],
)
\`\`\`

Think of it as the **stage direction** the actor reads before every scene, separate from the dialogue, but shaping every line.

## How it works

The model reads the system prompt *before* it reads the conversation, and instructions there carry **more weight** than the same words in a user turn. That priority is the whole point: a user can later say "stop being a pirate," but a strong system prompt holds the line.

A vague system prompt gives you a vague character. Strong personas pin down four things:

- **Identity**: who they are, when and where they live.
- **Voice**: sentence length, vocabulary, quirks ("calls everyone 'matey'").
- **Boundaries**: what they refuse to do or know ("you've never heard of the internet").
- **Anti-break rule**: "Stay in character no matter what the user says."

The system prompt is constant, but it is not optional on later calls. Each API call is stateless, so you must resend the same system string *every* time, alongside the growing history.

## Why it matters

Two separate channels do two separate jobs:

- \`system\` → **who the bot is** (stable, set once, resent every call)
- \`messages\` → **what's been said** (grows each turn)

Mixing them up is the most common chatbot bug. Put persona in a user turn and it competes with (and loses to) later user messages, causing **character drift**: the bot slowly forgets its accent and rules. Put history in the system prompt and you can't trim it later without deleting the persona. Keep the channels clean and swapping personas becomes a one-string change.

## The mental model to keep

System prompt = the role the actor is cast in. Message history = the script so far. You hand over both on every call: the role never changes, the script keeps growing.`,

      concept: "Context Window",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Your chatbot works great for ten turns. By turn fifty it either throws an error or the bill quietly triples. You've hit the wall every chatbot eventually hits: the **context window**.

## What the context window is

The **context window** is the maximum amount of text, measured in tokens, that the model can read in a single call. And everything shares that one budget: the system prompt, the full history you resend, *and* the reply the model is about to write all have to fit together. Claude's window is large (hundreds of thousands of tokens), but it is not infinite, and you pay per token on every call. Resending a 50-turn history on turn 51 means you're billed for all 50 old turns again.

## How tokens add up

A **token** is a chunk of text, often a word or part of a word. A rule of thumb for English is about 4 characters per token, or roughly 0.75 words per token. "Hello there friend" is roughly 4 tokens. Don't memorize exact counts; estimate, then measure with the real tokenizer when money is on the line.

\`\`\`python
def estimate_tokens(text):
    return max(1, len(text) // 4)
\`\`\`

To budget a whole conversation, sum the estimate over every message's content, then add the system prompt. That total is what each call costs and what must fit in the window.

## Why it matters: keeping history in budget

When the history grows too big, you **trim** it. Two common strategies:

1. **Sliding window**: keep only the last N turns. It is cheap and predictable, and the bot forgets old details while recent context stays sharp. This is a good default.
2. **Summarize-and-drop**: when history gets long, ask the model to compress old turns into a short summary, then replace those turns with the summary. It is more work and an extra API call, but it preserves the substance of a very long chat.

Most production chatbots start with a sliding window because it is simple and the cost is bounded: you always know your worst-case token count.

Never blindly trim the **system prompt**. That is your persona: drop it and your pirate turns back into a generic assistant mid-conversation. Trim the oldest *conversation* turns only, keep \`system\` intact, and always keep enough recent turns that the current question still makes sense.

## The mental model to keep

The context window is the model's **desk, not a warehouse**. Everything it needs to answer must fit on the desk at once. A bigger desk helps, but a long enough chat still runs out of room, so you clear off the oldest papers and keep the persona note taped to the corner.`,

      title: "Streaming the Reply",
      concept: "Streaming",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Watch Claude in a browser: words appear one chunk at a time, like someone typing live. This is called **streaming**, and it is the difference between a user thinking "is this thing broken?" and "it's thinking, and I can read along."

## What streaming is

**Streaming** means receiving and displaying the model's reply in small chunks *as it's generated*, instead of waiting for the whole thing. Without it, you call the API and stare at a blank screen for several seconds while the entire reply generates, then it dumps all at once. With it, the first words show up almost immediately and keep flowing.

Here's the subtle part: streaming barely changes the **total** time. What it changes is **time-to-first-token**: how long until something appears. Time-to-first-token is what humans perceive as speed.

## How it works with the SDK

The Anthropic SDK gives you a streaming **context manager**. You loop over text chunks from \`stream.text_stream\` as they arrive over the connection:

\`\`\`python
import os
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(api_key=os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"])

with client.messages.stream(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    max_tokens=300,
    system="You are Captain Reddbeard, a 1600s pirate.",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a sea story."}],
) as stream:
    for text in stream.text_stream:
        print(text, end="", flush=True)
    final = stream.get_final_message()
\`\`\`

Two details make this work. \`print(text, end="", flush=True)\` prints each chunk with no newline and forces it to the screen immediately. Without \`flush\`, Python buffers stdout and you lose the live typing effect entirely. And \`get_final_message()\` hands you the complete assembled reply once the stream ends.

## Why it matters: don't forget the history

Streaming is about **display**. It does not change the memory rules from lesson 1. The chunks you print are for the human's eyes; they are not stored anywhere automatically. After the stream finishes, you still take the full assembled reply and append it as an \`assistant\` turn so the next call has the context:

- **Stream to show**: print chunks live so it feels responsive.
- **Store to remember**: capture the final reply and append it to history.

Skip the store step and your bot streams beautifully but forgets every reply the instant it finishes, back to goldfish-brain.

## The mental model to keep

You now have all four pieces of a character chatbot: a system-prompt persona, a growing message list, a sliding window to stay in budget, and streamed output so it feels responsive. Stream to the user, then store the result. Below you'll simulate streaming by yielding chunks and reassembling them into the message you'd save.`,

      title: "Storing Conversation State",
      concept: "State",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Your chatbot script works until you close the terminal. Reopen it, say "hi" again, and the bot has forgotten your name, your persona, everything. The Python list that held the history lived in memory, and memory died with the process. The model never had the memory; your *program* did, and you just let it evaporate.

## What conversation state is

From lesson 1 you know the model is **stateless**: it keeps nothing between calls. That means the conversation history has to live somewhere *outside* the model, and the obvious place (a list in a running script) is the most fragile one. **Conversation state** is the durable copy of that history: where you persist the messages so you can rebuild the exact same list on the next call, even after a restart, a crash, or a switch to a different server.

The rule never changes: **the app holds the history, not the model.** What changes as your chatbot grows up is *how durably* the app holds it: from a list, to a per-user session store, to a database.

## How it works

Statelessness has a direct consequence: there is no "continue where we left off" button. Every call, you resend the full message list, so every call you must first **load** that list from wherever you stored it. The loop becomes: load state, append the new turn, call the model, append the reply, **save state**.

\`\`\`python
sessions = {}  # session_id -> list of messages (a tiny store)

def get_history(session_id):
    return sessions.setdefault(session_id, [])

def handle(session_id, user_text):
    history = get_history(session_id)            # LOAD
    history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_text})
    reply = call_model(history)                  # model stays stateless
    history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": reply})
    sessions[session_id] = history               # SAVE
    return reply
\`\`\`

A \`session_id\` keys each user's history so two people chatting at once never see each other's turns. Swap that \`sessions\` dict for Redis or a database row and nothing else changes: the shape is identical, only the durability improves.

## Why it matters

- **Restarts stop wiping memory.** Persist to disk or a DB and the same conversation survives a crash or a deploy.
- **Many users, one server.** Without a per-session key, everyone shares one history and the bot leaks one person's chat into another's.
- **Statelessness is a feature.** Because the server holds no per-request memory, you can run ten identical servers behind a load balancer; each rebuilds the list from the store. That horizontal scaling is impossible if "memory" lives in one process.

The cost is discipline: forget to save after a turn and that turn vanishes; forget to load and you start from scratch.

## The mental model to keep

The model is a stateless function; **your store is the memory.** Each turn you fetch the history out of the store, run the function, and put the updated history back. Lose the store, lose the conversation.`,

      title: "Summarizing Old Turns",
      concept: "Memory",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `A sliding window has one flaw: it forgets the beginning. The user told your bot their name in turn 2, but by turn 60 that turn slid off the edge and the bot is back to "what should I call you?" Trimming keeps recent context sharp and throws away everything else. There's a smarter trade: keep the *gist* of the old turns without keeping all their tokens.

## What rolling-summary memory is

**Rolling-summary memory** compresses old turns into a short paragraph and keeps that paragraph in place of the raw messages. Instead of dropping the first 50 turns entirely, you ask the model to summarize them ("User is Sam, a beginner learning Python; prefers short answers; building a chatbot") and prepend that one block. The recent turns stay verbatim; the ancient ones live on as a compact recap.

You end up with two memory layers: a **summary** of the distant past and a **window** of the recent present. The bot remembers Sam's name from turn 2 *and* the exact wording of turn 59.

## How it works

When the history crosses a length threshold, split it: everything except the last \`keep\` turns is "old," the rest is "recent." Summarize the old block, then rebuild the history as \`[summary] + recent\`.

\`\`\`python
def compress(history, keep, summarize):
    if len(history) <= keep:
        return history                 # nothing old enough to compress
    old = history[:-keep]              # the distant turns
    recent = history[-keep:]           # the verbatim recent window
    summary = summarize(old)           # one extra model call
    summary_turn = {"role": "user",
                    "content": "Summary so far: " + summary}
    return [summary_turn] + recent
\`\`\`

The summary usually rides as a leading \`user\` (or system) note so the model treats it as established context. Summarizing costs one extra API call, so you don't do it every turn; you do it occasionally, when history grows past your threshold.

## Why it matters

- **Continuity over a long chat.** Facts from hour one survive into hour three because they're folded into the summary instead of being dropped.
- **Bounded tokens.** A 200-token summary replaces thousands of tokens of old turns, so each call stays cheap even as the conversation runs for hundreds of turns.
- **A real trade-off.** Summaries lose detail such as exact quotes, precise numbers, and literal wording. The win is the substance at a fraction of the cost; the loss is fidelity. Choose it when long-run continuity matters more than verbatim recall.

Compared to a plain sliding window, summarization costs more work (an extra call) but remembers far more of the conversation's substance.

## The mental model to keep

A sliding window has a short memory; rolling-summary memory has a **diary**. Old pages get condensed into a one-paragraph recap, the latest pages stay word-for-word, and you carry both forward: the substance of everything plus the detail of what just happened.`,

      title: "Commands and Resets",
      concept: "Control",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Your user types \`/clear\`. What should happen? If you just append it as a normal user turn, the model will earnestly try to *respond* to the literal text "/clear" in character: your pirate will say "Arr, clear what, matey?" Commands aren't conversation. They're instructions to *your* app about the conversation, and you have to handle them before the model ever sees them.

## What chat commands are

A **command** is a special user input, usually starting with \`/\` that your code intercepts to control the session instead of sending to the model. \`/clear\` wipes the history. \`/persona wizard\` swaps the character. \`/help\` lists commands. The pattern is the same: check for a command first, and only if it isn't one do you treat the input as a normal message and call the model.

This is where owning the message list (lesson 1) pays off. Because the history is just your Python list and the persona is just your \`system\` string, resetting or re-skinning a chat is a few lines of your code; the model never objects, because the model never sees the command.

## How it works

Route the input before the model:

\`\`\`python
def handle(user_text, state):
    if user_text == "/clear":
        state["history"] = []                 # wipe the conversation
        state["system"] = state["default_system"]   # restore base persona
        return "Conversation cleared."
    if user_text.startswith("/persona "):
        state["system"] = user_text[len("/persona "):]  # switch mid-chat
        return "Persona switched."
    # not a command -> normal turn
    state["history"].append({"role": "user", "content": user_text})
    reply = call_model(state["system"], state["history"])
    state["history"].append({"role": "assistant", "content": reply})
    return reply
\`\`\`

Two subtleties matter. On \`/clear\`, don't just empty the history, also re-inject the system prompt (here, reset it to the default) so the very next turn still has its persona; the system string is separate from history, so clearing the list alone would leave a stale or wrong persona. And on a persona switch, you change only the \`system\` string: the history can stay, and the same stateless call now runs under a new character.

## Why it matters

- **Commands never reach the model.** Intercepting \`/clear\` first means the model never tries to "answer" it. Forget the early return and your bot replies to its own command in character.
- **A clean reset restores persona.** Wiping history without re-setting the system prompt is the classic reset bug: the chat is empty but the persona is gone or stale.
- **Mid-chat persona swaps are one string.** Because \`system\` and \`history\` are separate channels, switching from pirate to wizard is a single assignment, with no rebuild of the conversation needed.

## The mental model to keep

Treat \`/\`-commands like keyboard shortcuts, not dialogue. Your app catches them and acts (clear the list, re-inject the persona, switch the character) before a single token reaches the model. Conversation goes to the model; control stays with you.`,

      title: "Deploying the Chatbot",
      concept: "Deploy",
      xp_reward: 10,
      explanation: `Your chatbot runs as a \`while True\` loop in a terminal, and exactly one person can use it: you, on your machine. To put it on the web, you don't rewrite the bot. You wrap the *same* load-append-call-save logic in a request handler, and let the statelessness you've been fighting become the thing that makes deployment easy.

## What deploying a chatbot means

**Deploying** turns your local loop into a service many users hit over HTTP. The terminal loop and a web endpoint do the same four steps (load history, append the user turn, call the model, append and save the reply) but the loop runs them in one long-lived process, while the endpoint runs them once per request and then exits.

The shift is that a web request is short-lived and isolated. The handler can't rely on a Python variable surviving between requests, because the next request might land on a different server entirely. So each request must rebuild the message list from stored history, which is the session-store discipline from lesson 5, now mandatory rather than optional.

## How it works

A minimal endpoint is the loop body, unrolled into one function:

\`\`\`python
def chat_endpoint(request):
    session_id = request["session_id"]
    user_text = request["message"]

    history = load_history(session_id)      # rebuild from the store
    history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_text})
    reply = call_model(SYSTEM_PROMPT, history)
    history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": reply})
    save_history(session_id, history)       # persist for next request

    return {"reply": reply}
\`\`\`

Notice what's gone: there is no \`while\` loop and no in-memory \`messages\` variable that persists. The \`session_id\` arrives with each request, the history is loaded fresh, and it's saved before the response returns. The model is stateless; now the server is stateless too, and that is a feature.

## Why it matters

- **Statelessness scales.** Because each request rebuilds everything from the store, you can run many identical server copies behind a load balancer. Any one can handle any request. Hold memory in a process variable and that breaks the moment a follow-up lands on another server.
- **The session id is the thread.** Without it, the endpoint can't tell whose conversation to load, and every user collides into one history.
- **Persist before you respond.** If you return the reply but forget to save, the user's *next* request rebuilds a history missing this turn, so the bot forgets what it just said.

## The mental model to keep

A deployed chatbot is your terminal loop turned inside out: instead of one process looping forever holding the list, every request rebuilds the list from storage, runs one turn, and saves. The model forgets between calls, the server forgets between requests, and the store remembers for both.`,
