Complexity is O(M·N), one multiply-add per weight, which is why GPUs and BLAS `gemv` kernels exist to parallelize it.

Output the **index** (0-based) of the candidate with the **highest** cosine similarity to `q`.\n\nDo **not** use floating point. Because `||q||` is a common positive factor, comparing two candidates `A` and `B` reduces to comparing `(A·q)/||A||` against `(B·q)/||B||`. The norms are non-negative, so:\n\n- The **sign** of a candidate's cosine equals the sign of its dot product `a · q`. A candidate with a positive dot beats any candidate with a zero or negative dot, regardless of magnitude; a zero dot beats any negative dot.\n- When two candidates share the same sign, compare the **squares** of their cosines by cross-multiplication.

First, since `||a||` and `||q||` are non-negative, the sign of `cos` is the sign of the dot product, so a positive dot always beats a non-positive one before magnitudes even matter. Second, comparing `(A·q)/||A||` to `(B·q)/||B||` for same-sign candidates is, after squaring and cross-multiplying, the integer comparison `(A·q)^2·||B||^2` vs `(B·q)^2·||A||^2`; the shared `||q||^2` cancels. Those products can reach ~10^42, so 64-bit overflows and you promote the multiplications to `__int128`. The negative-dot case flips the comparison: among dissimilar candidates you want the one nearest zero, i.e. the smaller squared cosine. Real systems normalize once and use floats with HNSW indexes, but the exact integer version shows precisely what the metric is comparing, and never loses a tie to rounding.",
