The whole problem reduces to a single argmin pass in O(N) time and O(1) extra memory. The only subtlety is the tie-break, updating only on a strict improvement preserves the first (smallest) index. Real systems replace this exhaustive scan with smarter optimizers (random search, Bayesian optimization, Hyperband) once the grid grows too large to evaluate fully, but they all answer the same question this problem does: which configuration minimizes the loss.",

      "Ternary search exploits **unimodality**: on a strictly convex function the value first decreases then increases, so comparing two interior probes always tells you which third of the bracket cannot contain the minimum. Each iteration discards a third of the range, giving O(log(hi−lo)) evaluations versus O(hi−lo) for a brute scan. Working with strict convexity (`a ≥ 1`) and a strict-improvement tie-break guarantees the smallest minimizing `x`. The same one-dimensional search underlies learning-rate finders and line-search steps inside larger optimizers; switching to floating-point probes and a tolerance-based stop turns this exact integer version into the continuous golden-section / ternary search used in practice. The key correctness invariant is keeping the true minimizer always inside `[lo, hi]` as the bracket shrinks.",
