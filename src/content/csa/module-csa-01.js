      "explanation": "## What Is a Primitive Type?\n\nIn Java every value lives in a **typed** variable. A **primitive type** stores a single, simple value directly in memory, not a reference to an object. The AP Computer Science A exam uses only **three** primitive types:\n\n- **int**: whole numbers like `42`, `-7`, `0`. Range is about ±2.1 billion.\n- **double**: real numbers with a fractional part like `3.14`, `-0.5`, `2.0`.\n- **boolean**: a truth value, either `true` or `false`.\n\nJava is **statically typed**: you must declare a variable's type before using it, and that type never changes.\n\n## Declaring and Initializing\n\nA **declaration** names a variable and its type. **Initialization** gives it a first value. You can combine both:\n\n```java\nint score = 100;        // declaration + initialization\ndouble price = 9.99;    // a real number\nboolean passed = true;  // a truth value\n```\n\nThe **assignment operator** `=` copies the value on the right into the variable on the left. Read `score = 100` as \"score gets 100\", not \"score equals 100\".\n\n## Why Types Matter\n\nThe type controls:\n\n- **What values fit**: you cannot store `3.14` in an `int`.\n- **How much memory** is used and the legal range.\n- **What operations** are allowed (math on numbers, logic on booleans).\n\n## Reading Input with Scanner\n\nTo read values typed by a user, AP CSA uses `Scanner`. Each method matches a type:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n        int age = sc.nextInt();        // reads an int\n        double gpa = sc.nextDouble();  // reads a double\n        System.out.println(age);\n        System.out.println(gpa);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n`nextInt()` reads an integer; `nextDouble()` reads a decimal. The Scanner skips whitespace and newlines automatically, so values may be on separate lines.\n\nUnderstanding these three types and how to declare them is the bedrock for everything else in Unit 1.",

      "title": "Literals and Naming",
      "explanation": "## What Is a Literal?\n\nA **literal** is a fixed value written directly in source code. The type of a literal is decided by how you write it:\n\n- **int literal**: digits with no decimal point: `42`, `0`, `-7`.\n- **double literal**: has a decimal point or exponent: `3.14`, `2.0`, `0.5`, `1.5e3`.\n- **boolean literal**: the reserved words `true` and `false`.\n\nThe distinction matters. `5` is an int literal; `5.0` is a double literal. They look similar but behave differently in arithmetic, as later lessons show.\n\n```java\nint count = 10;       // 10 is an int literal\ndouble rate = 0.25;   // 0.25 is a double literal\nboolean ready = true; // true is a boolean literal\n```\n\n## Identifiers and Naming Rules\n\nThe name of a variable is its **identifier**. Java requires:\n\n- Start with a letter, underscore `_`, or `$` (use letters in AP CSA).\n- Followed by letters, digits, or underscores.\n- **No spaces** and no reserved words like `int` or `class`.\n- Identifiers are **case-sensitive**: `total` and `Total` are different.\n\n## Convention: camelCase\n\nBy convention, variable names use **camelCase**: start lowercase, capitalize each later word:\n\n```java\nint studentCount = 30;\ndouble averageScore = 88.5;\nboolean isComplete = false;\n```\n\nGood names describe the data they hold. `numStudents` is far clearer than `x`. The exam rewards readable code, and clear naming reduces bugs.\n\n## final Constants\n\nAdding the keyword **final** makes a variable a **constant**: its value cannot change after initialization. Constants use ALL_CAPS by convention:\n\n```java\nfinal int MAX_SCORE = 100;\nfinal double PI = 3.14159;\n```\n\nAttempting to reassign a `final` variable is a compile-time error. Constants document fixed values and prevent accidental changes.\n\nKnowing how literals carry type and how to name variables cleanly keeps your code correct and readable as programs grow.",

      "title": "Integer Arithmetic and Output",
      "explanation": "## Arithmetic Operators\n\nJava provides five core arithmetic **operators** for numbers:\n\n- `+` addition\n- `-` subtraction\n- `*` multiplication\n- `/` division\n- `%` modulus (remainder)\n\nWhen both operands are `int`, the result is an `int`. This lesson focuses on integer math with `+`, `-`, and `*`; division is covered next.\n\n```java\nint a = 7;\nint b = 3;\nint sum = a + b;   // 10\nint diff = a - b;  // 4\nint prod = a * b;  // 21\n```\n\n## Printing Output\n\nJava has two main ways to send text to the console:\n\n- **System.out.println(x)** prints `x` then moves to a **new line**.\n- **System.out.print(x)** prints `x` and stays on the **same line**.\n\n```java\nSystem.out.print(\"Sum: \");\nSystem.out.println(10);   // Sum: 10\nSystem.out.print(5);\nSystem.out.print(6);      // 56 on one line\n```\n\nNotice how `print` lets you build a line piece by piece, while `println` finishes the line.\n\n## String Concatenation\n\nThe `+` operator does double duty. With numbers it adds; with a **String** on either side it **concatenates** (joins text):\n\n```java\nint total = 25;\nSystem.out.println(\"Total = \" + total);  // Total = 25\n```\n\nHere `total` is converted to text and glued after `\"Total = \"`. Be careful: `\"x\" + 2 + 3` produces `x23` (left to right), but `2 + 3 + \"x\"` produces `5x` because the numeric addition happens first.\n\n## Putting It Together\n\nMost programs read input, compute with arithmetic, and print a result. Mastering integer operators plus `print`/`println` lets you produce exactly the output a problem requires, spacing and newlines included. The exam frequently tests whether you can predict console output precisely, so trace each statement carefully.",

      "explanation": "## Division Depends on Types\n\nThe `/` operator behaves very differently depending on the **types** of its operands. This is one of the most tested and most error-prone ideas in Unit 1.\n\n### Integer Division\n\nWhen **both operands are int**, Java performs **integer division**: it divides and **truncates** (throws away) any fractional part, it does not round.\n\n```java\nint a = 7 / 2;   // 3, not 3.5\nint b = 9 / 4;   // 2\nint c = 1 / 2;   // 0\n```\n\nThe remainder is simply discarded. `7 / 2` is `3` because 2 goes into 7 three full times. Truncation always moves toward zero, so `-7 / 2` is `-3`.\n\n### Double Division\n\nIf **at least one operand is a double**, Java performs **floating-point division** and keeps the fractional part:\n\n```java\ndouble x = 7.0 / 2;   // 3.5\ndouble y = 7 / 2.0;   // 3.5\ndouble z = 7.0 / 2.0; // 3.5\n```\n\nEven one double \"promotes\" the whole expression to double arithmetic. This is called **type promotion**.\n\n## A Classic Trap\n\nConsider:\n\n```java\ndouble result = 7 / 2;   // result is 3.0, NOT 3.5\n```\n\nWhy? The right side `7 / 2` is computed **first** using int division (both are ints), giving `3`. Only then is `3` stored into the double, becoming `3.0`. The variable's type does **not** change how the expression is evaluated, the operand types do.\n\nTo get `3.5`, make an operand a double **before** dividing:\n\n```java\ndouble result = 7.0 / 2;  // 3.5\n```\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nComputing averages, percentages, and rates almost always requires double division. Forgetting to promote an operand silently produces wrong, truncated answers. Always ask: are both operands int? If so, expect truncation.",

      "title": "The Modulus Operator",
      "explanation": "## What Modulus Computes\n\nThe **modulus operator** `%` returns the **remainder** after integer division. While `/` gives the quotient, `%` gives what is left over.\n\n```java\nint r1 = 7 % 3;   // 1  (7 = 2*3 + 1)\nint r2 = 10 % 5;  // 0  (divides evenly)\nint r3 = 4 % 9;   // 4  (9 goes into 4 zero times, remainder 4)\n```\n\nA helpful identity: for positive ints, `a == (a / b) * b + (a % b)`. The quotient and remainder fit back together perfectly.\n\n## Extremely Common Uses\n\nModulus is one of the most useful operators in all of programming:\n\n- **Even or odd**: `n % 2 == 0` is true exactly when `n` is even.\n- **Divisibility**: `n % k == 0` means `n` is divisible by `k`.\n- **Last digit**: `n % 10` extracts the ones digit of a number.\n- **Wrapping / cycling**: `(i + 1) % size` cycles an index back to 0.\n\n```java\nint n = 47;\nint lastDigit = n % 10;   // 7\nboolean isEven = n % 2 == 0; // false\n```\n\n## Combining / and %\n\nTogether, `/` and `%` let you break a number apart:\n\n```java\nint total = 137;\nint dollars = total / 100;  // 1\nint cents = total % 100;    // 37\n```\n\nThis pattern converts a count of pennies into dollars and cents, or seconds into minutes and seconds.\n\n## Behavior with Negatives\n\nIn Java, the result of `%` takes the **sign of the left operand**:\n\n```java\nint x = -7 % 3;   // -1\nint y = 7 % -3;   //  1\n```\n\nThe AP exam focuses on non-negative operands, but knowing this avoids surprises. Modulus only works with integer types in AP CSA, applying it to typical int values produces an int remainder. Master `%` and a huge family of problems (digit manipulation, cycles, parity checks) becomes straightforward.",

      "title": "Casting Between Types",
      "explanation": "## Why Cast?\n\nSometimes you need to convert a value from one primitive type to another. A **cast** explicitly tells Java to treat a value as a different type. The syntax is the target type in parentheses before the value:\n\n```java\ndouble d = 9.7;\nint n = (int) d;   // 9, fractional part dropped\n```\n\n## int to double (Widening)\n\nConverting an `int` to a `double` is a **widening** conversion. It is safe and Java does it automatically (implicitly), but you may cast explicitly for clarity:\n\n```java\nint count = 7;\ndouble x = count;         // implicit widening -> 7.0\ndouble y = (double) count; // explicit, same result\n```\n\n## double to int (Narrowing)\n\nConverting a `double` to an `int` is a **narrowing** conversion. It can lose information, so Java requires an **explicit cast**. Casting to int **truncates**: it drops the fractional part, it does NOT round:\n\n```java\nint a = (int) 3.99;   // 3, not 4\nint b = (int) 8.2;    // 8\nint c = (int) -2.9;   // -2 (toward zero)\n```\n\n## The Most Important Use: Forcing Double Division\n\nRecall that int / int truncates. Casting one operand to double fixes this:\n\n```java\nint total = 7;\nint count = 2;\ndouble avg = (double) total / count;  // 3.5\n```\n\nThe cast `(double) total` makes the left operand a double, so the division is double division. Watch precedence: a cast binds **tighter** than `/`, so `(double) total / count` casts `total` first, then divides. Compare:\n\n```java\ndouble wrong = (double)(total / count);  // 3.0, int division happened first!\ndouble right = (double) total / count;   // 3.5\n```\n\n## Rounding by Hand\n\nSince casting truncates, round a positive double by adding 0.5 first:\n\n```java\ndouble val = 3.7;\nint rounded = (int)(val + 0.5);  // 4\n```\n\nCasting is essential for averages, percentages, and controlling exactly how numbers convert. Always remember: double-to-int truncates toward zero.",

      "title": "Compound Assignment Operators",
      "explanation": "## Updating a Variable\n\nPrograms constantly update variables based on their current value, adding to a running total, decreasing a counter, scaling a number. The long form is:\n\n```java\nint score = 10;\nscore = score + 5;   // score is now 15\n```\n\nThis reads the old `score`, adds 5, and stores the result back. Because this pattern is so common, Java offers **compound assignment operators** that do the same thing more concisely.\n\n## The Compound Operators\n\nEach combines an arithmetic operator with `=`:\n\n- `+=` add and assign\n- `-=` subtract and assign\n- `*=` multiply and assign\n- `/=` divide and assign\n- `%=` mod and assign\n\n```java\nint x = 10;\nx += 5;   // x = x + 5  -> 15\nx -= 3;   // x = x - 3  -> 12\nx *= 2;   // x = x * 2  -> 24\nx /= 5;   // x = x / 5  -> 4  (int division!)\nx %= 3;   // x = x % 3  -> 1\n```\n\n`x += 5` is exactly equivalent to `x = x + 5`. The same type rules apply: `x /= 5` uses integer division when `x` is an int.\n\n## Increment and Decrement\n\nFor adding or subtracting exactly 1, Java provides shortcuts:\n\n- `x++` increment by 1 (same as `x += 1`)\n- `x--` decrement by 1 (same as `x -= 1`)\n\n```java\nint count = 0;\ncount++;   // 1\ncount++;   // 2\ncount--;   // 1\n```\n\nThese appear constantly in loops to advance a counter.\n\n## Compound Operators with Doubles\n\nCompound operators work on doubles too, following double arithmetic:\n\n```java\ndouble total = 100.0;\ntotal *= 1.1;   // 110.0\ntotal /= 4;     // 27.5\n```\n\n## Why They Matter\n\nCompound assignment makes accumulation code shorter and clearer, and `++`/`--` are the standard way to step counters. They are heavily used in loops and array processing later in the course. Just remember they inherit the same int-versus-double behavior as their full-form equivalents, `count /= 2` on an int still truncates.\n\nWith primitives, literals, arithmetic, division rules, modulus, precedence, casting, and compound assignment, you now command the full toolkit of Unit 1.",
