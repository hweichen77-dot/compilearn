      "explanation": "## What a Class Is\n\nA **class** is a blueprint that describes a kind of object. It bundles together two things: **state** (the data an object remembers) and **behavior** (the actions an object can perform). Every object you create from the class is an **instance** of it, and each instance carries its own copy of the state.\n\nThink of a class like an architectural plan for a house. The plan is not a house you can live in, but from one plan you can build many houses. Each house (object) has its own paint color and furniture (state) even though they all share the same floor plan (class).\n\n## The Parts of a Class\n\nA typical AP CSA class has four sections, written in this order by convention:\n\n- **Instance variables**: the fields that hold each object's state, usually `private`.\n- **Constructors**: special methods that initialize a new object.\n- **Accessor and mutator methods**: let outside code safely read or change the state.\n- **Other methods**: the behaviors that operate on the state.\n\n```java\npublic class Dog {\n    private String name;      // instance variable (state)\n    private int age;          // instance variable (state)\n\n    public Dog(String n, int a) {   // constructor\n        name = n;\n        age = a;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {       // accessor\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public String speak() {         // behavior\n        return name + \" says woof\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Objects vs. Classes\n\nYou never run a class directly. Instead you build objects from it using the `new` keyword:\n\n```java\nDog d = new Dog(\"Rex\", 3);\nSystem.out.println(d.speak());   // Rex says woof\n```\n\nHere `Dog` is the **class** (the blueprint) and `d` refers to one **object** (a built instance). The variable `d` stores a **reference** to the object, not the object itself.\n\nKey ideas to keep:\n\n- A class defines **state** and **behavior** once.\n- Objects are concrete instances built with `new`.\n- Each object has its **own** copy of the instance variables.\n- The class name is capitalized by convention (`Dog`, `Student`, `BankAccount`).",

      "explanation": "## State Lives in Instance Variables\n\nThe **state** of an object is everything it remembers about itself. In Java, that state is stored in **instance variables** (also called **fields**). They are declared inside the class but **outside any method**, so every method of the object can use them.\n\n```java\npublic class Counter {\n    private int count;   // instance variable\n}\n```\n\nBecause they live at the class level, instance variables exist for the entire lifetime of the object, unlike **local variables** which exist only while their method runs.\n\n## Default Values\n\nIf a constructor does not assign an instance variable, Java gives it a **default value** automatically:\n\n- numeric types (`int`, `double`) default to `0` / `0.0`\n- `boolean` defaults to `false`\n- object references (like `String`) default to `null`\n\nLocal variables get **no** default, you must initialize them before use, or the compiler complains.\n\n## Each Object Has Its Own State\n\nBecause every object carries its own instance variables, changing one object never affects another:\n\n```java\nCounter a = new Counter();\nCounter b = new Counter();\na.increment();   // a.count is now 1\n// b.count is still 0\n```\n\nThis independence is the whole point of objects: `a` and `b` model two separate counters.\n\n## Naming and Scope\n\nKey distinctions to remember:\n\n- **Instance variables** describe object state and persist for the object's life.\n- **Local variables** and **parameters** exist only during a single method call.\n- Instance variables are typically `private` so only the class itself can change them.\n\n```java\npublic class BankAccount {\n    private double balance;       // state, persists\n\n    public void deposit(double amount) {  // amount is local\n        balance = balance + amount;       // update state\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen you read `balance` inside a method without any object name in front of it, Java assumes you mean *this* object's `balance`. That implicit reference is the foundation we build on in later lessons with the `this` keyword.",

      "explanation": "## What a Constructor Does\n\nA **constructor** is a special method whose only job is to initialize a new object's instance variables. It runs automatically when you use `new`. Two rules define a constructor:\n\n- Its name is **exactly the class name**.\n- It has **no return type**: not even `void`.\n\n```java\npublic class Point {\n    private int x;\n    private int y;\n\n    public Point(int startX, int startY) {\n        x = startX;\n        y = startY;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCalling `new Point(3, 4)` runs this constructor with `startX = 3` and `startY = 4`, setting the object's `x` and `y`.\n\n## The Default Constructor\n\nIf you write **no constructor at all**, Java silently provides a hidden **no-argument constructor** that leaves every field at its default value. The moment you write *any* constructor, that free one disappears:\n\n```java\npublic class Point {\n    private int x, y;\n    public Point(int x, int y) { this.x = x; this.y = y; }\n}\n\nPoint p = new Point();   // COMPILE ERROR, no zero-arg constructor exists\n```\n\nIf you still want `new Point()` to work, you must write it yourself.\n\n## Overloaded Constructors\n\nA class may have **several constructors** as long as their parameter lists differ. This is called **overloading**:\n\n```java\npublic class Point {\n    private int x, y;\n\n    public Point() {           // origin\n        x = 0;\n        y = 0;\n    }\n\n    public Point(int x, int y) {\n        this.x = x;\n        this.y = y;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nJava picks the matching constructor by the arguments you pass. `new Point()` runs the first; `new Point(5, 2)` runs the second.\n\n## Validating Input\n\nConstructors are a good place to guard against bad data:\n\n```java\npublic Person(int age) {\n    if (age < 0) {\n        age = 0;\n    }\n    this.age = age;\n}\n```\n\nKey takeaways: a constructor matches the class name, has no return type, initializes state, and can be overloaded so objects can be built in different ways.",

      "explanation": "## Reading and Changing State Safely\n\nInstance variables are usually `private`, so outside code cannot touch them directly. To let other code work with an object's state, a class exposes **public methods**. Two common kinds are accessors and mutators.\n\n## Accessor Methods (Getters)\n\nAn **accessor** (or **getter**) returns the value of an instance variable without changing it. By convention its name starts with `get`, and its return type matches the variable:\n\n```java\npublic class Student {\n    private String name;\n    private int grade;\n\n    public String getName() {   // accessor\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public int getGrade() {     // accessor\n        return grade;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAn accessor that returns a `boolean` often starts with `is` instead, like `isEmpty()`.\n\n## Mutator Methods (Setters)\n\nA **mutator** (or **setter**) changes the value of an instance variable. Its name usually starts with `set`, it takes the new value as a parameter, and it returns `void`:\n\n```java\npublic void setGrade(int newGrade) {\n    grade = newGrade;\n}\n```\n\nBecause a mutator controls the change, it can **validate** input, something direct field access could never do:\n\n```java\npublic void setGrade(int newGrade) {\n    if (newGrade >= 0 && newGrade <= 12) {\n        grade = newGrade;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow the object refuses impossible grades, keeping its state valid.\n\n## Why Methods Instead of Public Fields\n\nUsing methods as a gate between the outside world and the data gives you control:\n\n- You can **validate** values before storing them.\n- You can **compute** a returned value instead of storing it (`getArea()` from width and height).\n- You can change how data is stored later without breaking other code.\n\n```java\npublic class Rectangle {\n    private int width, height;\n    public int getArea() {        // computed accessor\n        return width * height;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nKey idea: accessors **read** state and return a value; mutators **change** state and usually return `void`. Both keep the object in charge of its own data.",

      "explanation": "## What this Refers To\n\nInside an instance method or constructor, **`this`** is a reference to **the object the method was called on**. When you write `d.speak()`, inside `speak()` the keyword `this` refers to the same object `d` points to. It lets an object talk about itself.\n\n## Resolving Name Conflicts\n\nThe most common use of `this` is to fix a naming clash. A constructor parameter and an instance variable often share a name for readability. Without `this`, the parameter **shadows** the field:\n\n```java\npublic class Point {\n    private int x;\n    private int y;\n\n    public Point(int x, int y) {\n        x = x;   // BUG: assigns the parameter to itself\n        y = y;   // the instance variables stay 0\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUsing `this` makes the left side mean the *field* and the right side the *parameter*:\n\n```java\npublic Point(int x, int y) {\n    this.x = x;   // this.x is the field, x is the parameter\n    this.y = y;\n}\n```\n\n## Passing the Current Object\n\nBecause `this` is a reference to the current object, you can pass it to other methods or return it:\n\n```java\npublic class Account {\n    private double balance;\n\n    public Account deposit(double amount) {\n        this.balance += amount;\n        return this;          // hand back the same object\n    }\n}\n```\n\nReturning `this` lets calls be chained: `acct.deposit(10).deposit(5)`.\n\n## When You Can Omit this\n\nIf there is no name conflict, `this` is optional. These two lines do the same thing inside a method:\n\n```java\nbalance = balance + amount;        // implicit this\nthis.balance = this.balance + amount;  // explicit this\n```\n\nKey points:\n\n- `this` always refers to **the object the method is running on**.\n- Use `this.field = param;` to assign a parameter to a same-named instance variable.\n- `this` is only meaningful inside **instance** methods and constructors, never inside `static` methods.",

      "concept": "encapsulation",
      "xp_reward": 10,
      "explanation": "## Hiding the Internals\n\n**Encapsulation** is the practice of bundling an object's data together with the methods that operate on it, while hiding the data from outside code. In Java this is enforced with **access modifiers**, mainly `private` and `public`.\n\n- `private`, visible only inside the same class.\n- `public`, visible everywhere.\n\nThe standard pattern is **private fields, public methods**: lock the data down, then expose carefully chosen methods as the only doorway.\n\n```java\npublic class BankAccount {\n    private double balance;          // hidden state\n\n    public void deposit(double amt) {  // public gate\n        if (amt > 0) balance += amt;\n    }\n\n    public boolean withdraw(double amt) {\n        if (amt > 0 && amt <= balance) {\n            balance -= amt;\n            return true;\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    public double getBalance() {\n        return balance;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCode outside `BankAccount` cannot write `acct.balance = -1000000;`. It must go through `deposit` and `withdraw`, which enforce the rules.\n\n## Why Encapsulation Matters\n\nMaking fields `private` gives three big benefits:\n\n- **Validity**: methods reject bad data, so the object never enters an impossible state.\n- **Control**: the class decides exactly what outsiders can do.\n- **Flexibility**: you can change how data is stored internally without breaking other code, as long as the public methods behave the same.\n\n## A Broken Invariant\n\nImagine `balance` were `public`. Any line anywhere could do `acct.balance -= 99999;` and overdraw the account. Encapsulation makes that impossible because the only way to reduce the balance is `withdraw`, which checks the funds first. The rule \"balance is never negative\" is called an **invariant**, and encapsulation is what protects it.\n\nKey points:\n\n- Encapsulation = data hiding + controlled access.\n- Mark instance variables `private`; expose `public` methods.\n- This protects the object's **invariants** and keeps the rest of the program simpler.",

      "explanation": "## Two Kinds of Members\n\nA class can have **instance members** that belong to each object, and **static members** that belong to the **class itself**. The `static` keyword is the difference.\n\n- An **instance variable** has one copy *per object*.\n- A **static variable** (class variable) has **one copy shared by all objects**.\n\n```java\npublic class Robot {\n    private static int count = 0;   // shared by ALL robots\n    private int id;                 // unique to each robot\n\n    public Robot() {\n        count++;        // every new robot bumps the shared count\n        id = count;     // and takes the next id\n    }\n\n    public static int getCount() {  // static method\n        return count;\n    }\n\n    public int getId() {            // instance method\n        return id;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAfter `new Robot(); new Robot(); new Robot();`, `Robot.getCount()` returns `3`, while each robot's `id` is `1`, `2`, `3`.\n\n## Static Methods\n\nA **static method** belongs to the class and is called on the class name, not an object:\n\n```java\nint total = Robot.getCount();   // call on the class\nMath.max(3, 7);                 // Math.max is static\n```\n\nBecause a static method has no specific object, it **cannot use `this`** and **cannot read instance variables** directly, there is no single object to read them from. It can only touch static fields and its own parameters.\n\n## Choosing Static or Instance\n\nUse the table of intent below:\n\n- If the data or behavior describes **one object**, make it an **instance** member.\n- If it describes the **whole class** or is a pure utility, make it **static**.\n\n```java\npublic class Circle {\n    public static final double PI = 3.14159;  // shared constant\n    private double radius;                      // per-object state\n\n    public double area() {\n        return PI * radius * radius;            // instance uses static\n    }\n}\n```\n\nKey points:\n\n- `static` members belong to the **class**; instance members belong to **objects**.\n- One static variable is **shared**; each instance variable is **per object**.\n- Static methods are called on the class name and **cannot access** instance variables or `this`.",

      "concept": "toString",
      "xp_reward": 10,
      "explanation": "## Giving an Object a Readable Form\n\nBy default, printing an object shows something cryptic like `Point@1b6d3586`. Overriding **`toString`** lets you control the text Java uses whenever an object is printed or joined to a String:\n\n```java\npublic class Point {\n    private int x, y;\n\n    public Point(int x, int y) {\n        this.x = x;\n        this.y = y;\n    }\n\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"(\" + x + \", \" + y + \")\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow `System.out.println(p)` prints `(3, 4)`. Java automatically calls `toString` when an object appears where a String is expected, so `\"P = \" + p` works too. The method must be `public`, take no parameters, and return a `String`.\n\n## Method Decomposition\n\n**Method decomposition** is the practice of breaking a big task into several small, well-named methods, each doing one thing. Small methods are easier to read, test, and reuse. Compare a tangled method with a decomposed version:\n\n```java\npublic class Order {\n    private double price;\n    private int qty;\n\n    private double subtotal() {\n        return price * qty;\n    }\n\n    private double tax() {\n        return subtotal() * 0.08;\n    }\n\n    public double total() {\n        return subtotal() + tax();   // reads like English\n    }\n}\n```\n\nEach helper (`subtotal`, `tax`) is `private` because it is an internal detail; only `total` is `public`. The top-level method becomes a short, readable summary of the steps.\n\n## Guidelines for Decomposition\n\nGood decomposition follows a few rules:\n\n- Each method should do **one clear job** and be named for that job.\n- A method that grows long or has a comment like `// now compute tax` is a hint to extract a helper.\n- Helpers used only inside the class should be `private`.\n\nKey points:\n\n- Override `public String toString()` to give an object a meaningful printed form.\n- Java calls `toString` automatically during printing and String concatenation.\n- Decompose complex behavior into small, single-purpose methods, keeping internal helpers `private` and the public method readable.",
