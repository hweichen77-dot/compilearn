      "title": "Base Case and Recursive Case",
      "explanation": "## What Is Recursion?\n\n**Recursion** is when a method calls **itself** to solve a smaller version of the same problem. Every recursive method needs two ingredients:\n\n- A **base case**: the simplest input where the answer is known directly, with no further calls. This stops the recursion.\n- A **recursive case**: where the method calls itself on a **smaller** input, moving toward the base case.\n\nIf you forget the base case, or the recursive case never shrinks the problem, you get **infinite recursion** and a `StackOverflowError`.\n\n## A Classic Example: Factorial\n\nThe factorial `n! = n * (n-1) * ... * 1`, and `0! = 1`. Notice that `n! = n * (n-1)!`. That self-reference is the recursive case.\n\n```java\npublic static int factorial(int n) {\n    if (n <= 1) {     // base case\n        return 1;\n    }\n    return n * factorial(n - 1); // recursive case\n}\n```\n\nWhen we call `factorial(4)`:\n\n- `factorial(4)` returns `4 * factorial(3)`\n- `factorial(3)` returns `3 * factorial(2)`\n- `factorial(2)` returns `2 * factorial(1)`\n- `factorial(1)` hits the **base case** and returns `1`\n\nThen the results multiply back up: `2*1=2`, `3*2=6`, `4*6=24`.\n\n## Why the Base Case Matters\n\nThe base case is the **exit door**. Each recursive call must make progress toward it, here, `n` always decreases by 1, so we are guaranteed to reach `n <= 1`. Without that shrinking, recursion never ends.\n\n## Recursion vs. Iteration\n\nAnything a loop can do, recursion can do, and vice versa. Recursion shines when a problem is **naturally self-similar** (trees, divide-and-conquer). For simple counting it can be less efficient than a loop because each call uses memory, but it is often clearer.\n\nKey takeaway: **always write the base case first**, then express the bigger problem in terms of a smaller one.",

      "title": "The Call Stack",
      "explanation": "## How Recursion Actually Runs\n\nWhen a method is called, Java creates a **stack frame**: a small block of memory holding that call's **parameters**, **local variables**, and the spot to return to. These frames pile up on the **call stack**, a last-in-first-out (LIFO) structure.\n\nEach recursive call **pushes** a new frame. When a call finishes (returns), its frame is **popped** off, and control returns to the caller.\n\n## Tracing Through the Stack\n\nConsider counting down:\n\n```java\npublic static void countDown(int n) {\n    if (n == 0) {\n        return;            // base case\n    }\n    System.out.println(n);\n    countDown(n - 1);      // recursive call\n}\n```\n\nCalling `countDown(3)` builds the stack like this:\n\n- Push `countDown(3)` -> prints 3 -> calls `countDown(2)`\n- Push `countDown(2)` -> prints 2 -> calls `countDown(1)`\n- Push `countDown(1)` -> prints 1 -> calls `countDown(0)`\n- Push `countDown(0)` -> base case, returns -> pop\n- `countDown(1)` resumes, returns -> pop\n- `countDown(2)` resumes, returns -> pop\n- `countDown(3)` resumes, returns -> pop\n\nOutput: `3 2 1`.\n\n## Work Before vs. After the Call\n\nThe **position** of your work matters:\n\n- Code **before** the recursive call runs on the way **down** (during pushes).\n- Code **after** the recursive call runs on the way **back up** (during pops).\n\nIf we move the print **after** the call, the numbers come out reversed (`1 2 3`) because each print waits for the deeper call to finish first.\n\n## StackOverflowError\n\nThe stack has limited size. Too-deep recursion (or a missing base case) overflows it. This is the runtime cost of recursion: every pending call occupies memory until it returns.\n\nUnderstanding the stack lets you **predict output order** and explains why recursion uses more memory than a simple loop.",

      "title": "Tracing Recursion and Return Values",
      "explanation": "## Following the Values Back Up\n\nMany recursive methods **combine** the result of a smaller call with some local work. To trace them, you must follow values **down** (as arguments shrink) and **back up** (as returns combine).\n\n## The Fibonacci Sequence\n\nThe Fibonacci numbers are `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...` where each is the sum of the previous two:\n\n```java\npublic static int fib(int n) {\n    if (n < 2) {\n        return n;            // fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1\n    }\n    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);\n}\n```\n\nThis has **two** recursive calls per step, a **branching** (tree) recursion. To trace `fib(4)`:\n\n- `fib(4) = fib(3) + fib(2)`\n- `fib(3) = fib(2) + fib(1)`\n- `fib(2) = fib(1) + fib(0) = 1 + 0 = 1`\n- `fib(1) = 1`, `fib(0) = 0`\n\nWorking up: `fib(2)=1`, `fib(3)=fib(2)+fib(1)=1+1=2`, `fib(4)=fib(3)+fib(2)=2+1=3`.\n\n## Trace Tables\n\nA reliable way to trace is a **table** listing each call and what it returns once its sub-calls resolve. Always resolve the **deepest** call first, then substitute upward, exactly how the stack unwinds.\n\n## Watch For Repeated Work\n\nNotice `fib(2)` is computed more than once. Branching recursion can repeat sub-problems, making naive Fibonacci slow for large `n`. That is fine for tracing practice, but be aware it grows roughly exponentially.\n\n## Tips for Hand-Tracing\n\n- Write the base cases first so you instantly recognize them.\n- Replace each call with its returned value, innermost first.\n- Keep parentheses to avoid order mistakes.\n\nTracing is an AP exam staple: given a recursive method and a starting call, predict the **exact** returned value or printed output.",

      "explanation": "## Strings Are Recursive Too\n\nA **String** can be viewed as a first character plus the **rest** of the string. That self-similar structure makes strings perfect for recursion. The key tools are:\n\n- `s.length()`, number of characters; `length() == 0` is the natural base case.\n- `s.charAt(0)`, the first character.\n- `s.substring(1)`, everything **except** the first character (the smaller problem).\n\n## Reversing a String\n\nTo reverse, put the first character **last**: reverse the rest, then append the first character.\n\n```java\npublic static String reverse(String s) {\n    if (s.length() <= 1) {\n        return s;                       // base case\n    }\n    return reverse(s.substring(1)) + s.charAt(0);\n}\n```\n\nTrace `reverse(\"cat\")`:\n\n- `reverse(\"cat\") = reverse(\"at\") + 'c'`\n- `reverse(\"at\") = reverse(\"t\") + 'a'`\n- `reverse(\"t\") = \"t\"` (base case)\n- Build up: `\"t\" + \"a\" = \"ta\"`, then `\"ta\" + \"c\" = \"tac\"`\n\n## Counting Occurrences\n\nThe same pattern counts a target character: check the first char, then recurse on the rest.\n\n```java\npublic static int countChar(String s, char c) {\n    if (s.length() == 0) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n    int rest = countChar(s.substring(1), c);\n    return (s.charAt(0) == c) ? 1 + rest : rest;\n}\n```\n\n## Why This Pattern Works\n\nEach call handles **one** character and delegates the remaining `n-1` characters to a recursive call. Because the string shrinks by one each time, it always reaches the empty (or single-char) base case.\n\n## A Note on Performance\n\n`substring(1)` creates a new String each call, so string recursion is not the fastest approach, but it is wonderfully clear and a common AP pattern.

      "title": "Recursion on Arrays",
      "explanation": "## Processing Arrays Recursively\n\nUnlike strings, we usually do **not** create smaller arrays (that is wasteful). Instead we pass an **index** that marks where the current sub-problem begins. The array stays the same; the index shrinks the problem.\n\nThe pattern: a helper takes the array plus an index `i`. The **base case** is when `i` reaches `arr.length` (nothing left). Otherwise, combine `arr[i]` with the recursive result for `i + 1`.\n\n## Summing an Array\n\n```java\npublic static int sum(int[] arr, int i) {\n    if (i == arr.length) {\n        return 0;                 // base case: no elements left\n    }\n    return arr[i] + sum(arr, i + 1);\n}\n```\n\nCall it with `sum(arr, 0)`. Trace `{4, 2, 7}`:\n\n- `sum(arr,0) = 4 + sum(arr,1)`\n- `sum(arr,1) = 2 + sum(arr,2)`\n- `sum(arr,2) = 7 + sum(arr,3)`\n- `sum(arr,3) = 0` (base case)\n- Up: `7+0=7`, `2+7=9`, `4+9=13`\n\n## Finding a Maximum\n\nThe same index trick finds the largest element:\n\n```java\npublic static int max(int[] arr, int i) {\n    if (i == arr.length - 1) {\n        return arr[i];            // last element\n    }\n    return Math.max(arr[i], max(arr, i + 1));\n}\n```\n\n## Wrapper Methods\n\nUsers should not have to pass a starting index. A common technique is a **wrapper** (public) method that calls the recursive **helper** with index 0:\n\n```java\npublic static int sum(int[] arr) {\n    return sum(arr, 0);\n}\n```\n\nThis keeps the public interface clean while the helper does the recursion.\n\n## Key Idea\n\n**Index-based recursion** avoids copying data: the array is shared, and only the integer index moves forward. This mirrors how recursive search and sort algorithms operate in the next lessons.",

      "title": "Recursive Binary Search",
      "explanation": "## Searching by Halving\n\n**Binary search** finds a target in a **sorted** array by repeatedly cutting the search range in half. Recursion expresses this beautifully: each call searches a sub-range defined by `low` and `high` indices.\n\n## The Algorithm\n\n- Compute the middle index `mid = (low + high) / 2`.\n- If `arr[mid]` equals the target, return `mid`.\n- If the target is **smaller**, search the **left** half (`low..mid-1`).\n- If the target is **larger**, search the **right** half (`mid+1..high`).\n- **Base case**: if `low > high`, the range is empty, the target is not present, return `-1`.\n\n```java\npublic static int search(int[] arr, int target, int low, int high) {\n    if (low > high) {\n        return -1;                       // not found\n    }\n    int mid = (low + high) / 2;\n    if (arr[mid] == target) {\n        return mid;\n    } else if (target < arr[mid]) {\n        return search(arr, target, low, mid - 1);\n    } else {\n        return search(arr, target, mid + 1, high);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Why It Is Fast\n\nEach call eliminates **half** of the remaining elements, so binary search runs in **O(log n)** time. Searching 1,000,000 sorted items takes about 20 comparisons. Linear search would take up to a million.\n\n## Tracing an Example\n\nSearch for `7` in `{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}` with `low=0, high=4`:\n\n- `mid=2`, `arr[2]=5`; `7 > 5` -> search right `low=3, high=4`\n- `mid=3`, `arr[3]=7` -> found, return `3`\n\n## Critical Requirement\n\nBinary search only works on **sorted** data. On unsorted input it gives wrong answers. The base case `low > high` is what guarantees termination: every recursive call strictly shrinks the range, so it cannot loop forever.",

      "title": "Recursive Sorting: Merge Sort",
      "explanation": "## Divide and Conquer\n\n**Merge sort** is the textbook example of recursive **divide and conquer**. It works in three stages:\n\n- **Divide**: split the array into two halves.\n- **Conquer**: recursively sort each half.\n- **Combine**: **merge** the two sorted halves into one sorted result.\n\nThe **base case** is an array (or sub-array) of length 0 or 1, it is already sorted, so we stop.\n\n## The Merge Step\n\nMerging two sorted lists is the heart of the algorithm. Walk both lists with pointers, repeatedly taking the **smaller** front element:\n\n```java\npublic static int[] merge(int[] a, int[] b) {\n    int[] result = new int[a.length + b.length];\n    int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;\n    while (i < a.length && j < b.length) {\n        if (a[i] <= b[j]) result[k++] = a[i++];\n        else result[k++] = b[j++];\n    }\n    while (i < a.length) result[k++] = a[i++];\n    while (j < b.length) result[k++] = b[j++];\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\n## Putting It Together\n\n```java\npublic static int[] mergeSort(int[] arr) {\n    if (arr.length <= 1) {\n        return arr;                       // base case\n    }\n    int mid = arr.length / 2;\n    int[] left = Arrays.copyOfRange(arr, 0, mid);\n    int[] right = Arrays.copyOfRange(arr, mid, arr.length);\n    return merge(mergeSort(left), mergeSort(right));\n}\n```\n\n## Why It Is Efficient\n\nThe array is halved `log n` times, and each level does `O(n)` merging work, giving **O(n log n)** overall, far better than the `O(n^2)` of simple sorts on large inputs. Merge sort is also **stable** (equal elements keep their order) thanks to the `<=` in the merge.\n\n## The Recursive Shape\n\nNotice the two recursive calls (`mergeSort(left)` and `mergeSort(right)`), branching recursion again, but here each branch handles a **disjoint** half, so there is no wasteful repeated work like naive Fibonacci. This is recursion at its most powerful.",

      "explanation": "## Insertion Sort, Recursively\n\nWe usually write **insertion sort** with loops, but it also has an elegant recursive form that reinforces the **base case + smaller problem** mindset.\n\nThe idea: to sort the first `n` elements, first **recursively sort the first `n-1`**, then **insert** the `n`-th element into its correct spot among the already-sorted prefix.\n\n```java\npublic static void insertionSort(int[] arr, int n) {\n    if (n <= 1) {\n        return;                      // base case: 0 or 1 element is sorted\n    }\n    insertionSort(arr, n - 1);       // sort first n-1\n    int last = arr[n - 1];           // element to insert\n    int j = n - 2;\n    while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > last) {\n        arr[j + 1] = arr[j];         // shift right\n        j--;\n    }\n    arr[j + 1] = last;               // place it\n}\n```\n\nHere the **recursive call comes first** (sort the prefix), then the **insert** work happens on the way back up the stack.\n\n## Comparing the Two Sorts\n\n- **Merge sort**: divide and conquer, **O(n log n)**, uses extra arrays.\n- **Insertion sort**: builds a sorted prefix one element at a time, **O(n^2)** in the worst case, but fast on nearly-sorted data and sorts in place.\n\nBoth illustrate the same recursive principle: solve a smaller version, then do a little local work.\n\n## The Big Picture of Recursion\n\nAcross this unit you have seen one pattern repeat:\n\n- Identify a **base case** where the answer is trivial.\n- Express the problem in terms of a **smaller** version of itself.\n- Let the **call stack** combine the partial results.\n\nWhether reversing a string, searching a sorted array, or sorting with merge or insertion, recursion turns a hard problem into the **same problem, one step smaller**. Mastering that reframing is the real goal, the specific algorithm is just practice. When you can spot self-similarity, recursion becomes a natural, powerful tool.",
