      title: "Load the FAQ into Numbered Lines",
      concept: "loading and numbering the docs",
      explanation: `A support bot that "knows your product" knows nothing on its own. The model has never seen your FAQ. Every answer it gives has to come from text you hand it, in the same call, every time. This lesson builds the first piece: turning a plain FAQ file into something the model can point back to.

## What we're building

By lesson 8 you'll have a bot that answers strictly from your own docs and says "I don't know" when the docs don't cover it. The whole thing rests on one move: instead of dumping the FAQ as one blob of text, you **number every line** before it goes anywhere near the model. Give line 7 a number and you can cite it. Leave it buried in a wall of text and you can't.

## Numbering the source

\`\`\`python
def load_faq(text):
    lines = text.strip().split("\\n")
    return [(i + 1, line) for i, line in enumerate(lines) if line.strip()]

faq_text = """Q: What are your hours?
A: We're open 9am-5pm Monday through Friday.
Q: Do you ship internationally?
A: No, we currently only ship within the US."""

faq = load_faq(faq_text)
for num, line in faq:
    print(num, line)
\`\`\`

Each entry is now a \`(line_number, text)\` pair. Nothing fancy, just an index. Later lessons feed these numbered lines into the prompt and ask the model to name the line it used, and that only works because you numbered them first.

## Why numbering instead of raw text

Hand the model a raw FAQ and ask it to cite its source, and it will invent something plausible: a page number, a heading, whatever sounds right. You can't check any of it. A line number is a fact you control instead of a story the model makes up. You verify a cited number in one line of Python: check it's in range and print what's actually there. That is the point of grounding a bot in your own docs rather than trusting it to just know.

## Keeping the doc small on purpose

This project works with a **small** FAQ, a handful to a few dozen lines. That's the right scope for this build, not a shortcut you patch later. Once a knowledge base grows past what fits in one prompt, you add a search step to pick the relevant chunk first, and that's a bigger, different project. Here the whole FAQ fits in context every time, so there's no retrieval to get wrong. What's left is grounding and refusal, which is what these lessons are about.

## The mental model to keep

Picture the FAQ as a numbered exhibit list before a trial. Nobody testifies from memory; every claim points at "Exhibit 7." Over the next few lessons you're building the bot that only ever testifies from the exhibit list and says "not in evidence" when the answer isn't there.`,

      title: "The Grounded-Answer Prompt",
      concept: "stuffing docs into context",
      explanation: `The FAQ is numbered. Now wire it into a real prompt: the smallest version of the bot that answers a question using only the FAQ text you hand it. This is "stuffing" in the literal sense. You put the whole document into the system prompt.

## What context stuffing means

**Context stuffing** is the simplest way to ground a model in your own data. Paste the entire source document into the prompt, then ask the question. No search step, no database, no embeddings. You hand over everything and let the model read it. This only works because your FAQ is small enough to fit in one call, which is the scope of this project.

## Building the system prompt

The system prompt carries two things: the numbered FAQ text, and strict instructions about how to use it.

\`\`\`python
import os
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(api_key=os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"])

def build_system_prompt(numbered_faq):
    doc_block = "\\n".join(f"{num}: {line}" for num, line in numbered_faq)
    return f"""You are a support bot. Answer ONLY using the FAQ below.
FAQ:
{doc_block}

Rules:
- Base your answer only on the FAQ lines above.
- If the answer isn't in the FAQ, say so, don't guess.
"""

system = build_system_prompt(faq)

resp = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    max_tokens=300,
    system=system,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What are your hours?"}],
)
print(resp.content[0].text)
\`\`\`

The FAQ lives in \`system\` because it's the standing reference material for every question in the session, not a one-off message. The user's actual question goes in \`messages\`. It's the same split you've used in every project: config on one channel, live input on the other.

## Why the wording of the rules matters

"Answer using the FAQ" alone is too soft. The model still reaches for its general knowledge when the FAQ is thin. Two things tighten it. First, **"ONLY"** appears in the system prompt and again in the rules; that redundancy is deliberate, because a single soft instruction gets ignored more often than a rule stated twice. Second, an **explicit instruction for the "not covered" case**. Without it, the model fills gaps with invented answers instead of admitting the FAQ is silent. Lesson 4 turns this into a real, checkable refusal. For now you're just planting the instruction.

## The mental model to keep

Picture handing someone a single-page reference sheet and saying "answer questions using only this page." That's the whole system prompt: FAQ text plus a leash. Later lessons tighten the leash with a strict refusal (lesson 4) and a citation requirement (lesson 5), but the shape never changes: doc in the system prompt, question in messages.`,

      title: "Matching a Question to a Line",
      concept: "keyword grounding check",
      explanation: `Before you trust the model's answer, check it yourself: does this question connect to anything in the FAQ, or is the model about to answer from thin air? This lesson builds a plain-Python grounding check that runs *before* you call the model. It costs nothing and catches the obvious misses.

## Why check before calling the model

You can tell the model "only use the FAQ" and it will still wander now and then. So don't rely on instructions alone. Build a **pre-check**: a keyword overlap test between the user's question and each FAQ line. If nothing overlaps, the FAQ doesn't cover this, and you can skip the call or flag the answer as unsupported before it ships. It's the same instinct as lesson 5 in the playbook module, verify before you trust, aimed here at grounding.

## A simple overlap score

\`\`\`python
import re

def keywords(text):
    words = re.findall(r"[a-z0-9]+", text.lower())
    stop = {"a", "an", "the", "is", "are", "do", "you", "your", "what", "we"}
    return {w for w in words if w not in stop and len(w) > 2}

def best_match(question, numbered_faq):
    q_words = keywords(question)
    best_num, best_score = None, 0
    for num, line in numbered_faq:
        score = len(q_words & keywords(line))
        if score > best_score:
            best_num, best_score = num, score
    return best_num, best_score
\`\`\`

\`best_match\` returns the line number with the most overlapping keywords, plus the score. A score of 0 means no FAQ line shares a single meaningful word with the question, a strong signal the FAQ doesn't cover it.

## What this buys you

This doesn't replace the model reading the FAQ. It's a cheap, deterministic sanity check in pure Python with no network call, and two things fall out of it. The highest-scoring line is your best guess at "the line this question is about," which feeds lesson 5's citation requirement. And a score of 0 across every line means you can refuse before spending a single token on an API call.

## The mental model to keep

Think of this as the bouncer checking a list before the model ever talks to the customer. The bouncer works on keyword overlap, not real understanding, so it's not perfect, but it stops the cheapest, most obvious mismatches before they cost you a call or produce an invented answer. Real grounding is still the model reading the actual FAQ text. This keyword check is the fast, free layer in front of it.`,

      title: "Refusing What's Not There",
      concept: "refusing unsupported questions",
      explanation: `The most important behavior of this bot isn't answering well. It's knowing when to say **no**. A support bot that confidently answers a question your FAQ never covered is worse than useless, because it misleads the user. This lesson builds the refusal path: a strict, checkable rule for when the bot should decline.

## What "refusal" means here

**Refusal** is the bot recognizing that a question falls outside its FAQ and returning a fixed, honest "I don't have that in my docs" instead of guessing. It has to hold in two places at once. In the prompt, you tell the model exactly what to say when a question isn't covered and give it an exact phrase to use. In your own code, you use the keyword pre-check from lesson 3 as a second layer that forces a refusal even when the model tries to answer anyway.

## Prompting for a strict refusal

\`\`\`python
REFUSAL = "I don't have that information in my FAQ."

def build_system_prompt(numbered_faq):
    doc_block = "\\n".join(f"{num}: {line}" for num, line in numbered_faq)
    return f"""You are a support bot. Answer ONLY using the FAQ below.
FAQ:
{doc_block}

Rules:
- Base your answer only on the FAQ lines above.
- If the FAQ does not cover the question, reply with EXACTLY this sentence
  and nothing else: "{REFUSAL}"
- Never guess, never use outside knowledge, never apologize at length.
"""
\`\`\`

Giving the model an **exact string** for refusal, instead of "say you don't know," makes refusals recognizable in code (\`if reply == REFUSAL\`) and leaves no room for the model to hedge with a half-answer that reads like a refusal but sneaks in a guess.

## Backing it up in code

The prompt alone is a soft guarantee, since models sometimes ignore instructions. So you layer the lesson-3 keyword check on top as a hard one:

\`\`\`python
def answer(question, numbered_faq, model_reply):
    _, score = best_match(question, numbered_faq)
    if score == 0:
        return REFUSAL
    return model_reply
\`\`\`

When the keyword overlap is zero, you **override** whatever the model said and force the refusal yourself. This is defense in depth: the prompt asks nicely, the code enforces. A model that ignores the system prompt entirely still can't get an unsupported answer past this check.

## Why this is the core of the whole product

Everything else here, numbering, stuffing, citing, serves this one behavior: never say something your docs don't back up. A bot that answers 80% of questions correctly and confidently makes up the other 20% is unusable in support, because the user can't tell which 20% to distrust. A bot that either answers correctly or clearly says "I don't know" stays trustworthy even when it can't help, and that's the bar for shipping something like this.

## The mental model to keep

Think of the refusal as a circuit breaker. It doesn't prevent every possible mistake; it fails safe. The keyword check trips the breaker on the obvious misses, and the model's own instructions catch subtler ones. Both exist because either one alone would eventually let something through.`,

## What we're adding

You'll change the prompt to require a citation in a fixed, parseable format, then write a Python check that confirms the cited line exists and is one of the lines the model was shown. A citation the model invents, a line number that doesn't exist, is as dangerous as an invented fact, so it gets the same treatment: verify, don't trust.

## Prompting for a structured citation

\`\`\`python
def build_system_prompt(numbered_faq):
    doc_block = "\\n".join(f"{num}: {line}" for num, line in numbered_faq)
    return f"""You are a support bot. Answer ONLY using the FAQ below.

{doc_block}

Rules:
- Answer in ONE sentence, then a citation on its own line: "Source: line N"
  where N is the FAQ line number your answer came from.
- If the FAQ does not cover the question, reply with EXACTLY:
  "I don't have that information in my FAQ."
"""

# Expected model reply shape:
# "We're open 9am-5pm Monday through Friday.\\nSource: line 2"
\`\`\`

Asking for a fixed literal format, \`"Source: line N"\`, is what makes this checkable. Ask "cite your source" with no format and you get free-text citations in a dozen phrasings that you can't parse reliably.

## Parsing and verifying the citation

\`\`\`python
import re

def parse_citation(reply):
    match = re.search(r"Source: line (\\d+)", reply)
    if not match:
        return None
    return int(match.group(1))

def verify_citation(reply, numbered_faq):
    cited = parse_citation(reply)
    valid_numbers = {num for num, _ in numbered_faq}
    if cited is None:
        return False, "no citation found"
    if cited not in valid_numbers:
        return False, f"line {cited} doesn't exist in this FAQ"
    return True, cited
\`\`\`

\`verify_citation\` returns a pass/fail plus either the verified line number or the reason it failed. Two failure modes matter here. The model ignores the format and gives **no citation at all**, or it cites **a line that doesn't exist** and hallucinates a number. Both are bugs worth catching before the answer reaches a user, and both are now one function call to detect.

## Why citation-checking, not just citation-asking

Asking the model to cite is a prompting trick. Verifying the citation is a code guarantee. The distinction matters because a model under load, or handed an ambiguous question, will sometimes cite line 12 when line 12 doesn't exist in a 9-line FAQ. Catching that with one \`in\` check is nearly free, and it's the difference between a bot that looks trustworthy and one that is.

## The mental model to keep

Every non-refused answer now carries a receipt. You don't re-read the whole FAQ to trust the bot; you check the receipt. Does this line number exist, and does it say roughly what the bot claimed? That receipt turns "the bot said so" into "the bot said so, and here's exactly where."`,

      title: "Off-Topic and Malformed Input",
      concept: "handling off-topic and malformed replies",
      explanation: `Real users don't ask clean questions. They ask about the weather, paste three questions at once, submit an empty string. Sometimes the model itself replies in a shape you didn't ask for. This lesson hardens the bot against the messy middle: inputs and outputs that aren't wrong exactly, just not what you planned for.

## Three categories of mess

1. **Off-topic input.** "What's your favorite movie?" isn't a support question. The keyword check from lesson 3 already scores this near zero against a real FAQ, so it routes to refusal on its own. Worth stating plainly: off-topic and unsupported-but-on-topic get the same treatment, which is refuse.
2. **Empty or junk input.** A blank question, or one that's only whitespace or punctuation, has no keywords. \`keywords("")\` returns an empty set, so every score against it is 0. That's safe by construction, but only if you check for it before doing anything expensive.
3. **Malformed model output.** The model is supposed to answer in one sentence plus a citation line. Sometimes it won't: it skips the citation, adds commentary, or wraps the answer in markdown. Your citation-parsing code from lesson 5 already treats "no citation found" as a handleable case instead of crashing.

## A guarded answer function

\`\`\`python
def guarded_answer(question, numbered_faq, model_reply):
    if not question or not question.strip():
        return REFUSAL, None

    _, score = best_match(question, numbered_faq)
    if score == 0:
        return REFUSAL, None

    ok, result = verify_citation(model_reply, numbered_faq)
    if not ok:
        return REFUSAL, result  # treat an unverifiable citation as unsupported
    return model_reply, result
\`\`\`

Notice the shape. Every failure path, empty input, zero keyword overlap, missing or bad citation, converges on the same \`REFUSAL\` output. There's one way to say "I can help" and several ways to say "I can't," and all of them are explicit checks instead of spots where the code might silently do the wrong thing.

## Why converge on one refusal path

A bot with five different failure messages ("hmm", "unclear", "error", "not sure", "invalid") looks broken. A bot with one consistent refusal message looks intentional, like it was built to say "no" cleanly rather than sputter out garbage. Users trust a firm, consistent "I don't know" far more than one that glitches differently every time.

## Logging the reason, even if the user doesn't see it

The second return value in \`guarded_answer\`, the reason or citation, isn't for the user. It's for you. When you're debugging why the bot refused something it should have answered, "score was 0" versus "citation was invalid" versus "input was empty" are three different bugs to chase. Keep that detail even though the user-facing message stays identical.

## The mental model to keep

Hardening isn't adding more ways to answer. It's making every way to *not* answer land on one calm, predictable response. The bot should never look confused. It should look like it made a decision, because it did.`,

      title: "Watching Cost as the FAQ Grows",
      concept: "cost and token budget",
      explanation: `Context stuffing works fine at 10 FAQ lines and gets expensive fast at 500. Every question resends the *entire* FAQ, so the cost of this bot scales with how big your docs are, not how big the question is. This lesson builds the budget check that catches an FAQ before it grows past what's sane to stuff.

## Why cost scales with the doc, not the question

Every call to this bot sends the full numbered FAQ in the system prompt and a short question in messages. A one-word question and a ten-word question cost almost the same, because the FAQ dominates the token count. The lever you actually control is **how big the FAQ is allowed to get**, not how you phrase questions.

## Estimating the cost per call

\`\`\`python
def estimate_tokens(text):
    return max(1, len(text) // 4)

def estimate_call_cost(numbered_faq, question, system_template_overhead=60):
    doc_block = "\\n".join(f"{num}: {line}" for num, line in numbered_faq)
    faq_tokens = estimate_tokens(doc_block)
    question_tokens = estimate_tokens(question)
    return faq_tokens + question_tokens + system_template_overhead
\`\`\`

\`system_template_overhead\` accounts for the fixed wording around the FAQ: the rules, the "You are a support bot" framing, tokens that exist on every call no matter the doc size. Add it in explicitly rather than pretend the template is free.

## Setting a hard ceiling

\`\`\`python
FAQ_TOKEN_BUDGET = 2000

def check_faq_budget(numbered_faq):
    doc_block = "\\n".join(f"{num}: {line}" for num, line in numbered_faq)
    tokens = estimate_tokens(doc_block)
    if tokens > FAQ_TOKEN_BUDGET:
        raise ValueError(
            f"FAQ is {tokens} tokens, over the {FAQ_TOKEN_BUDGET} budget. "
            "Split it or switch to a retrieval-based design."
        )
    return tokens
\`\`\`

This check runs once when the FAQ loads, not on every question, since the doc size doesn't change per call. When it fails, that's not a bug to patch. It's a signal you've outgrown context stuffing and need the retrieval step this project left out (see lesson 1). Raising loudly here beats silently sending an enormous, expensive prompt on every question forever.

## Why a hard ceiling instead of a soft warning

A warning gets ignored. A raised exception forces a decision at the moment the FAQ is edited, right when a human is looking at it, instead of surfacing as a slow-creeping bill three weeks later. Cost bugs are uniquely nasty because nothing looks broken: the bot still answers correctly, it just quietly costs ten times what it should. Catching it loudly at load time is the cheap fix.

## The mental model to keep

Every call to this bot is billed for the whole reference sheet, not just the question asked. That's fine at FAQ size 20 and a real problem at FAQ size 2000. The budget check is a smoke alarm for that one failure mode. Cheap to install, easy to ignore until it matters, and the one thing standing between "small doc, small bill" and a bill nobody predicted.`,

## The full pipeline, in order

\`\`\`python
import os, re
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(api_key=os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"])
REFUSAL = "I don't have that information in my FAQ."

def answer_question(question, numbered_faq):
    check_faq_budget(numbered_faq)           # lesson 7: cost ceiling, raises if too big

    if not question or not question.strip(): # lesson 6: empty input guard
        return REFUSAL, None

    _, score = best_match(question, numbered_faq)  # lesson 3: keyword pre-check
    if score == 0:
        return REFUSAL, None

    system = build_system_prompt(numbered_faq)      # lesson 2: context stuffing
    resp = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
        max_tokens=300,
        system=system,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": question}],
    )
    reply = resp.content[0].text

    ok, result = verify_citation(reply, numbered_faq)  # lesson 5: citation check
    if not ok:
        return REFUSAL, result
    return reply, result
\`\`\`

Read it top to bottom and the whole project is one straight line: check the budget once, guard the input, pre-check grounding cheaply before spending a token, call the model with the stuffed FAQ, then verify what came back before trusting it. Nothing here is new. Lesson 8 is assembly, not invention.

## What "done" means for this bot

- It runs from a clean start: load an FAQ file, call \`answer_question\` in a loop reading from stdin.
- It never answers from outside the FAQ, verified twice, once by keyword pre-check and once by citation verification.
- Every real answer names its line, and every refusal is the same calm string.
- A too-large FAQ fails loudly at load time instead of quietly ballooning your bill.

If those four hold, you've got a shippable support bot, not a demo that happens to work on the examples you tried.

## Where this fits, and where it doesn't

This design is right for a small, stable FAQ: a handful to a few dozen entries that don't change every day. It's the wrong tool for a large, growing knowledge base. That's a retrieval system's job, picking the relevant few chunks out of thousands before touching the model. Knowing the boundary of what you built is part of shipping. This bot is honest about what it can answer and just as honest that it wasn't built to scale past a small FAQ.

## Your Portfolio

Finishing this lesson saves **FAQ Support Bot** to your Portfolio, alongside anything else you've built in this track. You now have a working version of the pattern underneath every "chat with your docs" product: stuff, ground, cite, refuse. Fancier versions add embeddings, vector search, or multi-document retrieval, but they're the same four moves with a smarter first step. You already know the last three.`,
