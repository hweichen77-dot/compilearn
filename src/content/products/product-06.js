      title: "Turning Mess into a Fixed Shape",
      concept: "the extraction job",
      explanation: `Raw text is everywhere: a signature block at the bottom of an email, a receipt someone pasted into a chat, a paragraph of meeting notes. A human reads it fine. Software can't do anything with it until it has structure. A **structured extractor** closes that gap. It reads messy free text and returns the same fixed set of fields every time, as JSON your program can trust.

## What we're building

Over eight lessons you'll build a tool that turns messy text into validated JSON: **contacts** (name, email, phone) and **invoices** (id, total, line items). The output is never a paragraph. It's a strict object with known keys, ready to drop into a database row or a spreadsheet cell.

## The one idea: a target schema

Everything starts with the **schema**, the exact shape you demand back. For a contact:

\`\`\`python
SCHEMA = {
    "name": "string",
    "email": "string",
    "phone": "string or null",
}
\`\`\`

The schema is a contract. It names every field, so the model knows what to look for and your code knows what to expect. Without one, the model returns a slightly different shape on every call and your parser is left guessing.

## The loop, with the work in two steps

It's the same six-step loop from the playbook. The interesting work happens in **prompt** and **parse**:

1. **Input**: the messy text.
2. **Prompt**: "extract exactly these fields as JSON."
3. **Call**: send it to the model.
4. **Parse**: pull the JSON object out of the reply.
5. **Validate**: are the required fields present and the right type?
6. **Ship**: a clean record.

Here's the real call you're heading toward:

\`\`\`python
import os
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(api_key=os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"])

msg = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    max_tokens=300,
    system="Extract a contact as JSON with keys name, email, phone.",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Reach Ada at ada@x.com."}],
)
print(msg.content[0].text)
\`\`\`

## Why "every time" is the hard part

Extracting one clean business card is a demo. Extracting ten thousand is the product, and some are missing a phone, some carry two emails, some arrive wrapped in chatty text. The schema is what makes that survivable. Once you know the exact shape you want, you can check the model against it and repair whatever is off.

## The drill below

No network here. You'll define a schema and write the check that reports which required fields a record is **missing**. That's the smallest piece of the validation you'll build up over the next seven lessons.`,

      title: "Put the Schema in the Prompt",
      concept: "schema-in-the-prompt",
      explanation: `The model returns whatever shape it feels like unless you tell it exactly what you want. "Give me the contact info" gets you a friendly paragraph. The fix is to put the **schema in the prompt**. Spell out the exact keys, the exact types, and ask for JSON and nothing else.

## Describe the shape, key by key

Don't ask for "the data." Ask for a JSON object with named keys and say what each one holds:

\`\`\`python
SCHEMA = {"name": "string", "email": "string", "phone": "string or null"}

def build_system(schema):
    lines = ["Extract a contact as a JSON object with exactly these keys:"]
    for key, typ in schema.items():
        lines.append(f'- "{key}": {typ}')
    lines.append("Return only the JSON object. No prose, no code fences.")
    return "\\n".join(lines)
\`\`\`

Building the prompt from the schema dict gives you one source of truth. Change the schema and the instructions change with it. They can't drift apart.

## Show one tiny example

A single example pins down the shape faster than a paragraph of rules. This is **one-shot prompting**: include an input and its ideal JSON output right in the system prompt, and the model pattern-matches on it.

## Say what to do with missing data

The most common bug in extraction is invention. There's no phone in the text, so the model makes one up. Head it off in the prompt: "If a field is not present in the text, use null. Never guess." That one sentence turns a hallucinating extractor into an honest one.

## The real call

\`\`\`python
msg = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    max_tokens=300,
    system=build_system(SCHEMA),
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": raw_text}],
)
import json
data = json.loads(msg.content[0].text)   # works only when output is clean
\`\`\`

That \`json.loads\` is the happy path. It works when the model returns bare JSON. Later lessons handle the frequent case where it doesn't.

## Why this matters

The prompt is the cheapest reliability you can buy. Every field name you spell out, every "use null when absent," every one-shot example is a bug you don't have to catch downstream. A vague prompt fails silently. The reply looks plausible and then breaks your parser one call in a hundred.

## The drill below

You'll build the system prompt from a schema dict, then parse a clean sample reply with \`json.loads\` and confirm its keys match the schema exactly.`,

      title: "Digging the JSON Out of the Reply",
      concept: "parsing JSON out of a reply",
      explanation: `You asked for JSON and only JSON. The model, being helpful, often returns \`Sure! Here is the contact:\` and then the JSON, or wraps it in a Markdown code fence. Feed that straight to \`json.loads\` and it throws. The fix is to stop trusting the reply to be clean and instead **dig the JSON object out** of whatever came back.

## The reply is rarely bare JSON

Three shapes you'll see constantly:

- Chatty prefix: \`Here's what I found:\\n{"name": "Ada"}\`
- Code fence: three backticks, \`json\`, the object, three backticks.
- Trailing note: \`{"name": "Ada"} Let me know if you need more!\`

## Find the object by its braces

A JSON object starts at the first \`{\` and ends at the last \`}\`. Slice between them and you've dropped the prose on either side:

\`\`\`python
def extract_json(text):
    start = text.find("{")
    end = text.rfind("}")
    if start == -1 or end == -1 or end < start:
        raise ValueError("no JSON object found")
    return text[start:end + 1]
\`\`\`

\`find\` gives the first opening brace, \`rfind\` the last closing brace. Everything before \`start\` and after \`end\` is chatter you throw away. This handles the code fence too. Backticks live outside the braces, so the slice skips them.

## Then parse the slice

\`\`\`python
import json

raw = msg.content[0].text
data = json.loads(extract_json(raw))
\`\`\`

Parsing the **slice** instead of the raw reply is the whole trick. \`json.loads(raw)\` chokes on the prefix. \`json.loads(extract_json(raw))\` doesn't, because the prefix is gone.

## Why not just ask the model to stop adding text?

You do, in the prompt, and it helps. But "return only JSON" is a strong nudge, not a guarantee. Assume the instruction sometimes fails and handle the mess anyway. Prompt for clean output and parse defensively regardless. Belt and suspenders.

## The mental model to keep

The reply is a haystack and the JSON is the needle. Rather than demand a needle-only haystack, learn to find the needle. First brace to last brace is your magnet.

## The drill below

You'll write \`extract_json\` and run it over three messy replies (prefix, code fence, trailing note), parsing each one into a dict.`,

      title: "Repairing Broken JSON",
      concept: "JSON repair",
      explanation: `Sometimes the slice you dug out still won't parse. The model left a trailing comma, or the whole thing is fenced, or a stray character snuck in. Rather than fail the extraction, run a small **repair pass**: a few cheap, safe fixes that turn almost-JSON into real JSON before \`json.loads\`.

## The breakages you'll actually see

- **Code fences**: the reply is wrapped in three backticks and \`json\`.
- **Trailing commas**: \`{"a": 1, "b": 2,}\` is legal in Python, illegal in JSON.
- **Whitespace** padding the object on either side.

Single quotes and unquoted keys also happen, but repairing those safely is hard (an apostrophe inside a name breaks naive fixes), so leave them to a retry rather than a regex.

## A small, safe repair function

\`\`\`python
import re, json

def repair_json(text):
    text = text.strip()
    text = re.sub(r"^\`\`\`[a-zA-Z]*\\n", "", text)   # drop opening fence
    text = re.sub(r"\\n\`\`\`$", "", text)            # drop closing fence
    start, end = text.find("{"), text.rfind("}")
    text = text[start:end + 1]
    text = re.sub(r",(\\s*[}\\]])", r"\\1", text)     # kill trailing commas
    return text
\`\`\`

The trailing-comma regex reads: a comma followed by optional whitespace and then a closing \`}\` or \`]\`, replaced with just the closing bracket. That one line handles the most common JSON breakage from LLMs.

## Repair, then parse, then know when to quit

\`\`\`python
def parse_or_none(raw):
    try:
        return json.loads(repair_json(raw))
    except (ValueError, json.JSONDecodeError):
        return None
\`\`\`

Return \`None\` on failure rather than crashing. \`None\` is a signal the caller can act on: log it, retry with the model, or flag the record for a human. A crash in the middle of a ten-thousand-row batch loses the other 9,999.

## Don't over-repair

Every repair rule is a small risk of corrupting good data. Keep the set tiny and boring. Fences and trailing commas cover most of what you'll see. When those aren't enough, the right move is to **ask the model again** (next lesson), not to bolt on ten more fragile regexes.

      title: "Validating the Required Fields",
      concept: "field validation",
      explanation: `The JSON parsed. That only means it was well-formed, not that it was **correct**. The extractor's real job is a contract: every required field present, and each value the right type. Parsing checks syntax. Validation checks meaning. This lesson is the spine of the whole tool.

## Parsing success is not correctness

\`json.loads\` happily accepts \`{"name": "Ada"}\` even when your schema demands name, email, and phone. It accepts \`{"amount": "fifty"}\` when amount should be a number. The JSON is fine. The data is wrong. You have to check it yourself.

## Two checks: presence and type

\`\`\`python
SCHEMA = {"name": str, "email": str, "amount": (int, float)}
REQUIRED = ["name", "email", "amount"]

def validate(record, schema, required):
    errors = []
    for key in required:
        if record.get(key) is None:
            errors.append(f"missing: {key}")
    for key, expected in schema.items():
        value = record.get(key)
        if value is not None and not isinstance(value, expected):
            errors.append(f"wrong type: {key}")
    return errors
\`\`\`

Presence first: a required key that's absent or \`null\` is a \`missing\` error. Then type: a present value that isn't the expected Python type is a \`wrong type\` error. An empty error list means the record is valid.

## Normalize while you're here

Extraction output should be predictable. When an optional field is absent, set it to \`None\` explicitly rather than leaving the key off, so every record has the same keys:

\`\`\`python
def finalize(record, schema):
    return {key: record.get(key) for key in schema}
\`\`\`

Now downstream code can write \`record["phone"]\` without a \`KeyError\`, whether the phone was found or not.

## Why this is the product

An extractor without validation is a guess with extra steps. What matters is that you can **prove** the returned record meets the contract before it lands in your database. Validation is the difference between "the model usually gets it right" and "bad records never reach production." When a record fails, you don't ship it. You retry or flag it, which is exactly the next lesson.

You'll validate a parsed record against a schema of required fields and types and report each error, catching a value that came back the wrong type.`,

      title: "When It Fails, Ask Again",
      concept: "retry with feedback",
      explanation: `Real inputs break things. The text is empty. The model returns two fields when you needed three. A value comes back the wrong type. A production extractor **recovers** instead of crashing. It handles the empty case without a call, and when validation fails it asks the model again, telling it exactly what was wrong.

## Handle the empty case first

The cheapest call is the one you don't make. Empty or whitespace-only input has nothing to extract, so short-circuit it:

\`\`\`python
def extract(text, schema):
    if not text.strip():
        return {key: None for key in schema}, ["empty input"]
    # ... otherwise call the model
\`\`\`

No tokens spent, nothing hallucinated, just a predictable all-null record.

## Retry with the error in the prompt

When a parsed record fails validation, don't retry blindly. Tell the model what broke. Feeding the validation errors back sharpens the second attempt:

\`\`\`python
def extract_with_retry(text, schema, required, max_retries=2):
    for attempt in range(max_retries + 1):
        record = call_and_parse(text, schema)
        errors = validate(record, schema, required)
        if not errors:
            return record, attempt + 1, True
        text_hint = text + "\\n\\nYour last answer had: " + "; ".join(errors)
        text = text_hint
    return record, max_retries + 1, False
\`\`\`

Each retry appends the specific problems (\`missing: phone\`) so the model corrects that exact gap instead of guessing again.

## Cap the retries

Retries cost money and time, and some inputs genuinely lack the data. No amount of re-asking will find a phone number that was never in the text. So cap attempts (two retries is a sane default) and, on final failure, return the best record you have with a \`valid: False\` flag. The caller decides whether to store it flagged, drop it, or send it to a human. What you never do is loop forever.

## Why this matters

The gap between a demo and a tool is exactly this behavior: it fails politely, recovers when it can, and gives up cleanly when it can't. An extractor that surfaces "3 records need review" is trustworthy. One that silently writes garbage, or crashes on row 4,000, is not.

      title: "Invoices, Nesting, and Cost",
      concept: "nested schemas and totals",
      explanation: `Contacts are flat, three string fields. Invoices are the harder, more valuable case: an id, a total, and a **list of line items**, each with its own fields. Nesting brings a kind of validation you can't do on contacts, since the numbers have to add up. Bigger documents bring another concern: cost.

## Nested schema

An invoice's schema has an array of objects inside it:

\`\`\`python
INVOICE_SCHEMA = {
    "invoice_id": "string",
    "total": "number",
    "items": [{"name": "string", "qty": "number", "price": "number"}],
}
\`\`\`

You spell the item shape out in the prompt too, so the model knows each line needs a name, quantity, and price.

## Validate the arithmetic

The check that earns its keep for invoices: the line items must sum to the stated total. If they don't, the extraction is wrong even when every field is present and typed correctly:

\`\`\`python
def validate_invoice(inv):
    errors = []
    for key in ("invoice_id", "total", "items"):
        if key not in inv:
            errors.append(f"missing: {key}")
    if errors:
        return errors
    computed = sum(it["qty"] * it["price"] for it in inv["items"])
    if computed != inv["total"]:
        errors.append(f"total mismatch: stated {inv['total']} vs computed {computed}")
    return errors
\`\`\`

This catches the model dropping a line item or misreading a price, errors that presence-and-type checks alone sail right past. Cross-field validation like this is where extraction earns its trust.

## Watch the cost of big documents

A contact is a sentence. An invoice can be a page. Figure roughly one token per four characters, and you pay for the input on every call, including every retry. A 4,000-character invoice is about 1,000 input tokens, and if you resend the whole thing on two retries you've tripled the bill for that record.

\`\`\`python
def estimate_tokens(text):
    return max(1, len(text) // 4)
\`\`\`

A few practical levers: don't retry more than you must, extract only the fields you actually need, and for a batch, measure the average document size before you run ten thousand of them.

## The drill below

You'll validate an invoice: check that the required top-level fields are present, then confirm the line items sum to the stated total. This catches the arithmetic, not just the shape.`,

      title: "Ship the Extractor",
      concept: "the full pipeline",
      explanation: `Time to assemble the pieces into one function you can point at any messy text and trust the output. Everything you built (schema prompt, brace-slicing, repair, validation, normalization) collapses into a single \`extract(text)\` that returns a clean record and a status. This is the deliverable.

## The pipeline, end to end

\`\`\`python
import os, json, re
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(api_key=os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"])
SCHEMA = ["name", "email", "phone"]

def extract(text):
    if not text.strip():
        return {k: None for k in SCHEMA}, "EMPTY"
    msg = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
        max_tokens=300,
        system="Extract a contact as JSON with keys name, email, phone. Use null if absent.",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": text}],
    )
    record = repair_and_parse(msg.content[0].text)   # slice + repair + json.loads
    if record is None:
        return {k: None for k in SCHEMA}, "PARSE_ERROR"
    clean = {k: record.get(k) for k in SCHEMA}
    missing = [k for k in SCHEMA if clean[k] in (None, "")]
    return clean, ("INCOMPLETE" if missing else "COMPLETE")
\`\`\`

One entry point, three honest outcomes: \`COMPLETE\`, \`INCOMPLETE\`, or \`PARSE_ERROR\`. The caller always gets a full-shaped record and a status, never a crash.

## Make it a real tool

Wrap it in a small CLI so anyone can run it:

\`\`\`python
import sys
if __name__ == "__main__":
    text = sys.stdin.read()
    record, status = extract(text)
    print(json.dumps(record, indent=2))
    print("status:", status)
\`\`\`

Now \`cat email.txt | python extractor.py\` prints validated JSON. That's shippable. It runs from a clean start with one command, handles empty and malformed input without crashing, and its output is documented by the schema.

## What "done" means here

- Every input yields a full-shaped record, never a missing key.
- Bad extractions are labeled (\`INCOMPLETE\`, \`PARSE_ERROR\`), not silently wrong.
- Someone else could run it from your instructions alone.

## It lands in your Portfolio

Finishing this lesson saves the **Structured JSON Extractor** to your **Portfolio** tab: a real tool that turns messy contacts and invoices into JSON you can trust. Keep a sample input and its output next to it. That pair is the proof it works.
