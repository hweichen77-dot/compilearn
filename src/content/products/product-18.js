      title: "Walking the Repo, Safely",
      concept: "repo ingestion",
      explanation: `Before you can answer a question about a codebase, you have to read the whole thing without choking on the junk. This lesson builds the ingestion step: walk a repository, keep the source files, drop everything that isn't code.

## What we're building

By lesson 8 you'll have a command-line tool. Point it at a repo, ask a question in English, and get back an answer with the exact file and line numbers it came from. Every RAG product starts the same way: get the raw documents into memory. For a codebase the documents are source files, and most of a repo isn't source.

## The problem: repos are mostly noise

A typical repository is full of things you never want to feed a model: \`.git/\` internals, \`node_modules/\` with tens of thousands of files, compiled artifacts, images, lockfiles. Read every file under the root and you'll spend your token budget on a \`package-lock.json\` before you reach the function that answers the question.

## How real ingestion works

\`\`\`python
import os

SKIP_DIRS = {"node_modules", ".git", "__pycache__", "venv", "dist", "build"}
CODE_EXTENSIONS = {".py", ".js", ".ts", ".jsx", ".tsx", ".go", ".java"}

def list_source_files(root):
    files = []
    for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(root):
        dirnames[:] = [d for d in dirnames if d not in SKIP_DIRS]
        for name in filenames:
            ext = os.path.splitext(name)[1]
            if ext in CODE_EXTENSIONS:
                files.append(os.path.join(dirpath, name))
    return sorted(files)
\`\`\`

Two details matter. \`dirnames[:] = ...\` mutates the list \`os.walk\` is iterating, in place. That is the only way to stop it descending into \`node_modules\` at all, instead of descending in and filtering the results afterward. Filtering by extension up front means you never open a \`.png\` or a \`.lock\` file.

## Why it matters

Ingestion mistakes stay invisible until they get expensive. A repo that sort of works in a demo can quietly send megabytes of vendored JavaScript to the model on every question, which wastes money and buries the real answer in noise. Getting the file list right, before any chunking or embedding, is the cheapest correctness you'll buy in this project.

## The mental model to keep

Ingestion is triage at the door. Every file gets a fast yes or no from its path alone, so you never open a file just to reject it by name. Below, build that filter by hand on a small fake repo, with no real filesystem yet, and watch which files survive and which get turned away.`,

      title: "Chunk by Function, Not by Character",
      concept: "function-level chunking",
      explanation: `A naive chunker slices code every N characters, and it will cut a function in half. One chunk ends up with a signature and no body; the next has a body with no idea what function it belongs to. Code chunking has to respect syntax, not just length.

## What we're building

This lesson replaces "split every 500 characters" with "split at every function and class." The unit of meaning in code is the function, not the paragraph. Everything inside \`def load_config(path):\` belongs together, and mixing it with half of the next function makes retrieval worse.

## Why character-based chunking fails on code

Text chunkers built for prose (split on blank lines, split every N tokens) assume meaning lives in nearby sentences. Code doesn't work that way. A function's signature, body, and closing line are one unit whether it runs 3 lines or 300. Cut it at a fixed character count and you'll split the signature from the logic, so neither half makes sense on its own once it's retrieved and shown to the model.

## How real chunking works

Python ships a parser for exactly this. The \`ast\` module turns source text into a tree of nodes, and every node knows which lines it spans.

\`\`\`python
import ast

def chunk_by_function(source, path):
    tree = ast.parse(source)
    lines = source.splitlines()
    chunks = []
    for node in tree.body:
        if isinstance(node, (ast.FunctionDef, ast.AsyncFunctionDef, ast.ClassDef)):
            start, end = node.lineno, node.end_lineno
            chunks.append({
                "path": path,
                "start_line": start,
                "end_line": end,
                "text": "\\n".join(lines[start - 1:end]),
            })
    return chunks
\`\`\`

\`node.lineno\` and \`node.end_lineno\` are 1-indexed line numbers \`ast\` computes for you, so there's no manual bracket-counting. For other languages you'd reach for a tree-sitter parser instead. Same idea: let a real parser find function boundaries rather than guessing with regex.

## Why it matters

A chunk that's a whole function answers a question on its own. When a user asks how the app loads its config, a chunk that is \`load_config\` end to end is the right size to retrieve and to quote back with a citation. A 500-character window covering the last third of one function and the first two-thirds of another answers nothing cleanly.

## The mental model to keep

Chunk at the seams the language already gives you. A function is a self-contained unit, and splitting there instead of at an arbitrary character count is the decision that matters most in a code-RAG pipeline. Below, parse a small file by hand with \`ast\` and confirm each chunk lines up with a real function.`,

      concept: "chunk metadata",
      explanation: `A chunk of code is useless as evidence unless you know exactly where it came from. This lesson adds the metadata that turns a chunk of text into a citable fact: which file, and which lines.

## What we're building

Every chunk from lesson 2 knows its own start and end line, but only within one file. To answer questions across a whole repo, each chunk also needs its file path and a stable ID that identifies it: \`path:start-end\`. That ID is what shows up in the final answer as \`[src/app.py:12-18]\`.

## Building the corpus

RAG systems call this collection of tagged, chunked documents the **corpus**. You build it by walking every source file, chunking each one, and stamping every chunk with its origin:

\`\`\`python
def build_corpus(files):
    corpus = []
    for path, source in files.items():
        for chunk in chunk_by_function(source):
            corpus.append({
                "id": f"{path}:{chunk['start_line']}-{chunk['end_line']}",
                "path": path,
                "start_line": chunk["start_line"],
                "end_line": chunk["end_line"],
                "text": chunk["text"],
            })
    return corpus
\`\`\`

The id is deterministic and readable on purpose. A random UUID would work too, but a UUID tells a user nothing when it shows up in an answer. \`src/app.py:12-18\` tells them exactly where to look, with no lookup table.

## Why this matters: citations are just IDs, shown

The whole answer-with-file-and-line feature comes down to this: keep the ID attached to every chunk from the moment it's created, through embedding, retrieval, and the final prompt, then print it back out next to whatever text it produced. Separate a chunk's text from its ID at any point and you can't recover the citation later. **Metadata has to travel with the chunk everywhere it goes.**

## A common mistake

It's tempting to store chunks as a flat list of strings and keep a separate parallel list of paths. That works until the two lists drift out of sync after one filtering step, and now your citations are wrong in the worst way: confident, specific, and pointing at the wrong file. Keep path, line numbers, and text together in one object per chunk.

## The mental model to keep

Every chunk is a **fact with a source**, not just a string. The ID is the footnote number; the path and line range are what the footnote says. Below, build a small corpus from a few files by hand and confirm every chunk's ID matches its path and line range.`,

      title: "Retrieval Tuned for Code",
      concept: "hybrid code retrieval",
      explanation: `Semantic search built for prose has a blind spot on code. An embedding model can miss that a query naming the function \`get_user_by_id\` should retrieve the chunk that defines \`get_user_by_id\`. Retrieval for code needs a second signal beyond semantic similarity: exact identifier matches.

## What we're building

A retriever that combines two scores per chunk. One is how semantically similar the chunk is to the query, from an embedding comparison. The other is whether the query mentions an identifier, a function or variable name, that appears verbatim in the chunk's name. This is **hybrid retrieval**, and it's standard for code search because identifiers carry more precise meaning in code than words do in prose.

## Embedding code with a code-aware model

General-purpose text embeddings are trained mostly on prose. For code, use a model trained on code, like Voyage AI's \`voyage-code-2\`:

\`\`\`python
import voyageai

vo = voyageai.Client()
doc_result = vo.embed(
    [chunk["text"] for chunk in corpus],
    model="voyage-code-2",
    input_type="document",
)
query_result = vo.embed([query], model="voyage-code-2", input_type="query")
\`\`\`

Each chunk and the query become vectors of numbers. You measure similarity between two vectors with **cosine similarity**: the cosine of the angle between them, from -1 (opposite) to 1 (identical direction). Closer to 1 means more semantically related.

\`\`\`python
import math

def cosine_similarity(a, b):
    dot = sum(x * y for x, y in zip(a, b))
    norm_a = math.sqrt(sum(x * x for x in a))
    norm_b = math.sqrt(sum(y * y for y in b))
    return dot / (norm_a * norm_b)
\`\`\`

## Adding the code-specific boost

Cosine similarity alone still misses exact-match cases. A query like "what does load_config do" should favor the chunk named \`load_config\`, even if its embedding similarity is only decent. The fix is a small bonus added on top:

\`\`\`python
def hybrid_score(cosine_sim, query, chunk_name):
    bonus = 0.25 if chunk_name and chunk_name in query else 0
    return cosine_sim + bonus
\`\`\`

## Why it matters

Semantic search is tuned for "these two paragraphs mean similar things." Code search often needs "this exact name was mentioned," which is a precision problem, not a paraphrase problem. Blending the two covers both. A vague conceptual question still finds the right area of code through embeddings, and a specific "what does X do" question reliably finds X even when its embedding similarity is mediocre.

## The mental model to keep

Semantic similarity finds code that *means* the same thing; the identifier bonus finds code that *is* the thing being asked about. Below, rank a small set of chunks by a combined score, with no network call, using pre-computed similarity numbers so you can see how the bonus changes the ranking.`,

      title: "Answering With Citations",
      concept: "grounded answers with file:line refs",
      explanation: `A code assistant that answers confidently but won't say where the answer came from is a black box. This lesson wires retrieval into a prompt that forces every claim to point at a real file and line range.

## What we're building

Given a user's question and the top-ranked chunks from lesson 4, assemble a context block that labels every chunk with its citation, then tell the model to answer *only* from that context and cite the file:line range for every fact it states.

## Building the context block

Each retrieved chunk already has an \`id\` like \`src/app.py:3-5\` from lesson 3. Format them into a labeled block the model can read and refer back to:

\`\`\`python
def build_context(chunks):
    blocks = []
    for chunk in chunks:
        blocks.append(f"[{chunk['id']}]\\n{chunk['text']}")
    return "\\n\\n".join(blocks)
\`\`\`

## The system prompt does the grounding

\`\`\`python
SYSTEM = """You are a codebase assistant. Answer ONLY using the code
provided in CONTEXT below. Never guess about code you can't see.
For every claim, cite the exact chunk it came from in square
brackets, like [src/app.py:3-5]. If the context doesn't contain
the answer, say so instead of guessing."""

resp = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    max_tokens=500,
    system=SYSTEM,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"CONTEXT:\\n{context}\\n\\nQUESTION: {question}"}],
)
\`\`\`

Two rules do the work. "Answer only from context" stops the model from inventing plausible-looking code it never saw. "Cite in brackets" gives you a citation format you can check in code later.

## Parsing citations back out

Once the reply comes back, pull the citations out of the text so you can display them, or verify them in a later lesson:

\`\`\`python
import re

CITATION_RE = re.compile(r"\\[([\\w./-]+):(\\d+)-(\\d+)\\]")

def extract_citations(answer_text):
    return [f"{path}:{start}-{end}" for path, start, end in CITATION_RE.findall(answer_text)]
\`\`\`

## Why it matters

Citations turn a code assistant from "trust me" into "check me." A user who reads \`[src/auth.py:40-52]\` in an answer can jump straight to that function and verify the claim in seconds, instead of grepping the whole repo to guess what the model meant.

## The mental model to keep

The context block is the evidence, the system prompt is the rule that the model may only speak from that evidence, and the citation is the receipt. Below, extract citations from a sample reply with plain regex, with no network call, so you can see what the parsing step has to handle.`,

      title: "Budgeting the Retrieval Window",
      concept: "retrieval budget",
      explanation: `Retrieval doesn't stop at "find the best chunks." It has to stop at "find the best chunks that fit." Send too many and you blow past the context window or the bill; send too few and the answer misses key code. This lesson adds the budget check.

## What we're building

A function that walks chunks in ranked order (best match first, from lesson 4) and greedily keeps whichever ones fit inside a token budget, skipping any that duplicate a chunk already included.

## Why duplicates happen

The same chunk often surfaces twice. A query might match a function by embedding similarity and by the identifier bonus at once, landing it in the ranked list twice with two different scores. Sending the same 40 lines of code to the model twice wastes tokens and adds nothing.

\`\`\`python
def dedupe_and_budget(ranked_chunks, budget):
    seen = set()
    kept = []
    used = 0
    for chunk in ranked_chunks:
        key = (chunk["path"], chunk["start_line"], chunk["end_line"])
        if key in seen:
            continue
        cost = len(chunk["text"]) // 4
        if used + cost > budget:
            continue
        seen.add(key)
        kept.append(chunk)
        used += cost
    return kept, used
\`\`\`

Notice this **keeps going past a chunk that doesn't fit** instead of stopping the moment one is too big. A high-ranked, expensive chunk might not fit while the next few smaller ones still do, and each one you fit is useful context. Stopping early would waste budget you could have spent.

## Why the token math matters here

Every chunk you include is code, and code is often denser than prose, so a character-count estimate can undercount the real token cost on some languages. For a first pass, the rough "4 characters per token" estimate from earlier lessons is fine. For production accuracy, count with the real tokenizer before you ship.

## Why it matters

Without a budget, a big-repository question like "how does auth work end to end" can retrieve a dozen relevant functions that together blow past the context window, and the call fails. With a budget, you get a deterministic best-effort selection: the most relevant code that fits, and every call succeeds.

## The mental model to keep

Ranking answers "what's most relevant"; budgeting answers "how much of that can I afford to send." They're separate steps on purpose. Keep ranking pure and let budgeting decide the cutoff, so you can tune the budget without touching how relevance is scored.`,

      title: "Guarding Against Hallucinated Citations",
      concept: "citation verification",
      explanation: `A citation only means something if it's real. A model can format \`[src/auth.py:200-210]\` with full confidence even when no such chunk was ever retrieved, inventing a location that looks as trustworthy as a correct one. This lesson catches that.

## The failure mode

Everything from lesson 5 makes the model *format* citations correctly. None of it guarantees the citations are *true*. Two ways this breaks in practice:

1. The model paraphrases from its own training knowledge of common code patterns instead of the retrieved chunk, then attaches a citation that looks plausible but matches nothing you sent it.
2. The model cites a real file in the repo but a line range that was never part of any retrieved chunk, close enough to believe and wrong enough to send someone down the wrong path.

Both look identical to a correct citation until you check them against what was actually retrieved.

## The verification step

You already have the ground truth: the exact set of chunk IDs you put in the context block. Verifying a citation is a membership check against that set, nothing more:

\`\`\`python
def verify_citations(answer_text, retrieved_ids):
    cited = set(extract_citations(answer_text))
    retrieved = set(retrieved_ids)
    fabricated = cited - retrieved
    return fabricated
\`\`\`

If \`fabricated\` is non-empty, the answer references code that was never shown to the model. That's a strong signal to flag or reject the answer instead of displaying it as trustworthy.

## The other edge: no citations at all

An answer with zero citations is its own kind of failure. Either the model ignored the "always cite" instruction, or it's answering from general knowledge instead of your code. Either way, don't show that answer to a user as grounded fact without a warning.

\`\`\`python
def classify_answer(answer_text, retrieved_ids):
    cited = extract_citations(answer_text)
    if not cited:
        return "NO_CITATIONS"
    if set(cited) - set(retrieved_ids):
        return "UNGROUNDED"
    return "GROUNDED"
\`\`\`

## Why it matters

For a codebase assistant, a wrong citation is worse than no citation. It sends a developer to the wrong function while they trust the tool, so they lose time before they realize it. Checking every citation against the retrieved set before you show an answer is the cheapest way to keep that trust, and it costs nothing beyond a set difference.

## The mental model to keep

Extraction tells you what the model *claimed*. Verification tells you whether the claim is *true*. Never ship the first without the second. A codebase assistant that can't tell you when it's guessing is more dangerous than one that admits it doesn't know.`,

Eight lessons compress into roughly ten lines here, because each one solved one small piece correctly. The pipeline just calls them in order.

## What "shipped" means for this project

1. It runs on a real repo, top to bottom, from one function call.
2. A question with no relevant code in the repo gets \`NO_CITATIONS\`, not a confident guess.
3. Every answer that gets shown carries citations you've verified are real.

If those three hold, you have a tool that works, not a demo that only works on the one example you tested.

## A quick pre-ship checklist

- Does ingestion skip \`node_modules\`, \`.git\`, and build output? (lesson 1)
- Are chunks whole functions, not arbitrary character windows? (lesson 2)
- Does every chunk carry its path and line range through the whole pipeline? (lesson 3)
- Does retrieval catch both "what does X mean" and "what does function X do"? (lesson 4)
- Does the system prompt force citations, and can you parse them back out? (lesson 5)
- Is there a hard token budget so large repos can't blow the context window? (lesson 6)
- Do you reject or flag answers whose citations don't match what was retrieved? (lesson 7)

## Why it matters

A tool that answers questions about a codebase is only as trustworthy as its weakest link. Skip the budget step and it crashes on big repos. Skip the verification step and it lies convincingly. Shipping means every link holds, not just the happy path you tried in lesson 1.

## You're done, and it's in your Portfolio

Finishing this lesson saves **Codebase Assistant** to your Portfolio: a tool that reads a repository, retrieves relevant code, and answers with receipts. That's the shelf you're building toward, one verified, cited answer at a time.`,
