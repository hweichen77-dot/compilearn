      title: "Notes Are Too Big to Just Paste In",
      concept: "Split notes into paragraph-sized chunks so retrieval can point at the exact passage that answers a question.",
      explanation: `You have hundreds of markdown files: daily journals, meeting notes, recipe scraps, half-finished project plans. You want to ask "what did I decide about the budget last March?" and get a real answer with a pointer back to the note. Pasting your whole vault into one prompt does not work. It is too big, too expensive, and mostly irrelevant to any single question. The answer is **RAG**, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

## The RAG loop

1. **Index** every note once by splitting it into small, retrievable pieces called **chunks**.
2. **Retrieve** only the chunks that relate to the question, at question time.
3. **Synthesize** an answer from those chunks and **cite** which chunk backed which claim.

This lesson builds step 1. The rest of the project builds steps 2 and 3.

## Why chunk at all

A whole note is usually too coarse. One journal entry might cover breakfast, a work decision, and a doctor's appointment. If your question is only about the work decision, retrieving the entire entry wastes tokens on two paragraphs you don't need. Chunking splits each note into paragraph-sized pieces, so retrieval hands back the one paragraph that matters instead of a whole day.

\`\`\`python
def chunk_notes(notes):
    # notes: {"2024-03-04 Standup": "We agreed to cut the budget...\\n\\nAlso, lunch was good."}
    chunks = []
    for title, text in notes.items():
        paragraphs = [p.strip() for p in text.split("\\n\\n") if p.strip()]
        for i, para in enumerate(paragraphs, start=1):
            chunks.append({"note": title, "chunk_id": i, "text": para})
    return chunks
\`\`\`

Each chunk records where it came from in \`note\` and \`chunk_id\`. That metadata is what makes citations possible later. Lose it here and you can never point back to a source.

## What happens to each chunk next

In the next lesson, every chunk gets turned into a vector, called an **embedding**, that captures its meaning. Those vectors get stored next to the chunk's text and metadata. The collection of (text, metadata, vector) triples is your **index**. You build it once and reuse it for every question you ask.

## Why this matters

Without chunking you are stuck between two bad options. Send the whole vault every time and you pay for slow, noisy prompts. Send nothing and the model guesses from thin air, which sounds confident and is often wrong. Chunking is what makes precise search over your own notes possible.

## The mental model

Picture a librarian who cuts every book into index cards instead of shelving it whole, one idea per card, each card labeled with its book and page. When you ask a question she does not hand you a book. She hands you the three cards that answer it. Below you build that card-cutting step in pure Python. No network yet.`,

      title: "Turning Text Into Numbers You Can Compare",
      concept: "Turn each chunk into an embedding vector and rank chunks by cosine similarity so search matches on meaning, not exact words.",
      explanation: `Two sentences can mean almost the same thing while sharing barely a word. "I need to fix the login bug" and "auth is broken again" point at the same problem, and keyword search misses the match completely. To find notes by meaning, you turn every chunk into a vector of numbers, an **embedding**, and compare vectors instead of text.

## What an embedding is

An embedding is a list of floats, often hundreds or thousands of them, produced by a model trained so that similar meanings land near each other in that number space. You call an embedding model once per chunk when indexing, and once per question at query time.

\`\`\`python
import os, voyageai

vo = voyageai.Client(api_key=os.environ["VOYAGE_API_KEY"])

result = vo.embed(
    ["I need to fix the login bug", "auth is broken again"],
    model="voyage-3",
    input_type="document",
)
vectors = result.embeddings  # two lists of floats, close together in space
\`\`\`

You embed once and store the vector next to the chunk's text and metadata. A chunk that has not changed never gets re-embedded. That is the reason you build an index instead of embedding on every question.

## Comparing vectors with cosine similarity

To measure how similar two vectors are, use **cosine similarity**, the cosine of the angle between them. It ranges from -1 for opposite meaning to 1 for identical direction. It ignores vector *length* and looks only at *direction*. That matters because a short question and a long chunk can point the same way in meaning-space even when their raw magnitudes differ.

\`\`\`python
import math

def cosine_similarity(a, b):
    dot = sum(x * y for x, y in zip(a, b))
    norm_a = math.sqrt(sum(x * x for x in a))
    norm_b = math.sqrt(sum(y * y for y in b))
    return dot / (norm_a * norm_b)
\`\`\`

The dot product measures raw alignment. Dividing by both magnitudes normalizes it into the -1 to 1 range, so scores stay comparable across chunks of any length.

## Why this matters

Retrieval is only as good as this one number. Rank every chunk's embedding against the question's embedding by cosine similarity, and the highest scores are your most relevant notes, whatever the exact wording was. Get this step wrong, or skip normalizing, and your search turns into noise.

## The mental model

Picture every sentence as an arrow pointing somewhere in a giant idea-space. Similar ideas point roughly the same way. Cosine similarity answers how parallel two arrows are, and it gives you a number you can sort by. Below you implement it in pure Python and use it to rank a few toy vectors. No network call here. The real embedding call is the code you just read above.`,

      title: "Retrieval: Picking the Best Notes, and Admitting When None Fit",
      concept: "Cap retrieval at the top k chunks and drop anything below a similarity threshold, so the model gets relevant context or none.",
      explanation: `Ranking every chunk in lesson 2 is not retrieval on its own. It just orders everything. A real retriever also decides how many chunks to hand the model and whether any of them are good enough to send. That second decision matters more than it sounds. Forcing through the best match when even the best match scores 0.1 is how RAG apps confidently answer questions their notes never covered.

## Two knobs: k and threshold

- **k** caps how many chunks you send. Keep it small; 3 to 5 is typical. More chunks means more tokens, more cost, and more room for the model to get distracted by a weaker chunk.
- **threshold** is a minimum similarity score. A chunk that ranks first among bad options is still a bad option if its score is 0.12. Anything below the threshold gets dropped, even when it would otherwise make the top k.

\`\`\`python
def retrieve(index, query_vector, k=4, threshold=0.35):
    scored = []
    for entry in index:
        score = cosine_similarity(query_vector, entry["vector"])
        if score >= threshold:
            scored.append({**entry, "score": score})
    scored.sort(key=lambda e: e["score"], reverse=True)
    return scored[:k]
\`\`\`

Filter before you slice to k, not after. Slice first and you might keep three barely-relevant chunks because nothing better existed. Filter first and an empty or short result becomes the honest signal that nothing in the vault matches.

## Tuning the threshold

There is no universal right number. It depends on your embedding model and how tightly your notes are written. Start around 0.3 to 0.4 for cosine similarity, then adjust by testing real questions. Too low drags in noise. Too high starves the model of context it needed.

## Why this matters

An empty result after filtering is not a failure. It is information. It tells the next stage of the pipeline that the vault has nothing on this question, which is the exact signal a later lesson uses to skip the API call and return an honest "I don't know" instead of letting the model improvise from nothing.

## The mental model

A good research assistant hands you the three most relevant books off the shelf. If none of them are actually about your topic, she says she has nothing on this instead of handing you the least-irrelevant book anyway. Below you implement that filter-then-rank-then-cap retriever in pure Python.`,

      concept: "Number the retrieved chunks and instruct the model to answer only from them, tagging each claim with the source number that backs it.",
      explanation: `You now have the top few relevant chunks. The next job is turning them into a prompt that makes the model answer only from those chunks and mark which chunk backed each part of the answer. That is the difference between a chatbot and a research assistant with footnotes.

## Numbering the sources

Give every retrieved chunk a number, then reference that number in the system prompt's rules. The number becomes the citation marker the model is asked to use: \`[1]\`, \`[2]\`, and so on.

\`\`\`python
def build_context_block(chunks):
    lines = [f"[{i}] {c['note']}: {c['text']}" for i, c in enumerate(chunks, start=1)]
    return "\\n".join(lines)
\`\`\`

## The system prompt does the grounding

\`\`\`python
SYSTEM = """You are a research assistant answering questions using ONLY the
numbered notes provided below. Every claim in your answer must end with the
bracketed number(s) of the note(s) that support it, like [1] or [1][2].
If the notes do not contain the answer, say so plainly instead of guessing.
Never cite a number that isn't in the list you were given."""

def build_messages(question, chunks):
    context = build_context_block(chunks)
    user_turn = f"{context}\\n\\nQuestion: {question}"
    return [{"role": "user", "content": user_turn}]

resp = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    max_tokens=500,
    system=SYSTEM,
    messages=build_messages(question, retrieved_chunks),
)
\`\`\`

Notice the shape. The system prompt carries the *rule*, which is cite every claim and refuse to guess. The user turn carries the *data*, which is the numbered sources plus the actual question. That separation is the same discipline as every other product in this track: rules and input never mix.

## Why citation numbers, not source names

Numbers are compact and unambiguous. "According to [2]" is one token. "According to your March 4th standup notes" is many, and the model paraphrases it inconsistently from one call to the next. You map the number back to the real title and file path yourself after the model replies. That is the next lesson's job.

## Why this matters

Without an explicit citation rule, a model answering from context still writes fluent, confident prose, and you cannot tell which sentence came from which note, or whether it came from the notes at all instead of the model's general knowledge. The instruction to cite is what turns a plausible-sounding answer into one you can verify by clicking through to the source.

## The mental model

You are handing the model a numbered stack of index cards and one strict rule: every sentence needs a card number, or it does not get written. Below you build the numbered context block and the combined prompt in pure Python. The actual API call is the two lines shown above.`,

      title: "Extracting and Verifying Citations",
      concept: "Parse the citation markers out of the answer and check every number against the sources you actually sent, catching hallucinated citations.",
      explanation: `The model replied with something like "You bake bread at 450F [1]." Your job is not done. You need to pull the citation numbers back out of that text, map them to real note titles for display, and check that every number the model used points to a source you actually gave it. Models sometimes cite a number that does not exist, especially in longer answers. A hallucinated citation is worse than no citation, because it *looks* trustworthy.

## Pulling citations out with a regex

\`\`\`python
import re

def extract_citations(text):
    found = re.findall(r"\\[(\\d+)\\]", text)
    return list(dict.fromkeys(int(n) for n in found))  # unique, first-seen order
\`\`\`

\`re.findall\` grabs every \`[n]\` pattern as a string. Converting to \`int\` and deduping with \`dict.fromkeys\` keeps first-appearance order while dropping repeats, since a chunk can get cited several times in one answer.

## Verifying against the real source list

\`\`\`python
def verify_citations(cited, num_sources):
    return sorted(n for n in cited if n < 1 or n > num_sources)

def footnotes(cited, chunks):
    return [f"[{n}] {chunks[n - 1]['note']}" for n in cited if 1 <= n <= len(chunks)]
\`\`\`

If \`verify_citations\` returns anything non-empty, the model referenced a source number that was never in the context you sent. That is a hallucinated citation, and it is your signal to either retry the call with a firmer instruction or strip the bad marker before showing the user anything.

## Why this matters

Citations only build trust if you actually check them. A UI that prints "[1] Recipes" under an answer is honest only when you have verified that \`[1]\` is really what the model pointed at. Skip verification and citations become decoration: numbers that look like proof but were never confirmed to mean anything.

## Two failure modes to catch

- **Out-of-range citation**: the model wrote \`[7]\` when you gave it 3 sources. Always a bug, never valid.
- **No citations at all**: the model answered with zero \`[n]\` markers. That is not automatically wrong, since a "the notes don't say" answer needs none, but for a factual claim it is a red flag worth surfacing to the user or retrying.

## The mental model

      title: "When Nothing Matches: Refusing Gracefully",
      concept: "Split the top retrieval score into confidence bands so a no-match question returns an honest refusal instead of a fabricated answer.",
      explanation: `Ask your notes brain for your dentist's phone number when you never wrote it down, and a model handed empty or near-empty context will often still produce a fluent, confident-sounding guess. That is the most damaging failure mode in RAG: an answer that reads like it came from your notes but did not. Hardening a notes brain starts with refusing well.

## Confidence bands from the top retrieval score

Instead of a single yes/no threshold, split retrieval scores into three bands:

- **CONFIDENT**, score above a high bar: answer normally.
- **WEAK**, score in a middle band: the notes barely relate. Still worth trying, but tell the model to hedge and admit uncertainty.
- **NO_MATCH**, score below both: do not call the model at all.

\`\`\`python
def classify_confidence(top_score, confident_t=0.5, weak_t=0.3):
    if top_score >= confident_t:
        return "CONFIDENT"
    if top_score >= weak_t:
        return "WEAK"
    return "NO_MATCH"
\`\`\`

## Skipping the call entirely on NO_MATCH

\`\`\`python
def answer_question(question, index):
    hits = retrieve(index, embed(question), k=4, threshold=0.0)
    top_score = hits[0]["score"] if hits else 0.0
    label = classify_confidence(top_score)

    if label == "NO_MATCH":
        return "I don't have anything in your notes about that.", []

    hedge = ("The notes only weakly match this question. Answer cautiously "
              "and say so if you're not confident.\\n\\n") if label == "WEAK" else ""
    ...  # build the cited prompt from hits and call the model
\`\`\`

NO_MATCH never reaches the API. That is a cost and correctness decision as much as a UX one. Sending a model empty or irrelevant context and asking it to answer anyway invites a hallucination, and you pay for the privilege.

## Why the system prompt's refusal rule still matters

Confidence bands catch the case where nothing obviously matched. But even a CONFIDENT retrieval can be wrong in a quieter way: the top chunk might be tangentially related without actually answering the question. That is why lesson 4's system prompt line, "if the notes don't contain the answer, say so," stays in every prompt whatever the band. It is the model's second line of defense behind your retrieval gate.

## Why this matters

A tool that says "I don't know" when it genuinely does not know is more useful than one that never admits uncertainty. Users learn fast which assistants they can trust, and one confidently wrong answer costs more trust than ten honest "not found in your notes."

      title: "Cost and Scale: Deduping Notes Before You Pay to Embed",
      concept: "Drop exact-duplicate chunks before embedding and estimate the token bill, so a template-heavy vault does not triple your index cost.",
      explanation: `A real notes vault is messy. Daily journals copy-paste the same template into dozens of entries: "Mood:", "Top priority:", the same boilerplate headers. Every repeated chunk costs an embedding call, takes a slot in your index, and crowds genuinely unique content out of retrieval results. Before you scale to hundreds of notes, dedupe.

## Exact-duplicate detection

The cheapest, most reliable dedup catches chunks that are the same content with different casing or spacing, like "Buy milk" against "BUY MILK" against "Buy   milk", by normalizing before comparing.

\`\`\`python
def normalize(text):
    return " ".join(text.lower().split())

def dedup_chunks(chunks):
    seen = set()
    unique = []
    for chunk in chunks:
        key = normalize(chunk["text"])
        if key not in seen:
            seen.add(key)
            unique.append(chunk)
    return unique
\`\`\`

Keep the first occurrence's original text so display casing looks natural, and use the normalized key only for comparison.

## Near-duplicate detection

Exact-text dedup will not catch two chunks that say almost the same thing in different words. That needs a comparison of their *embeddings*, not their raw text. If two chunks' cosine similarity is above a very high bar, say 0.98, they are near-duplicates even with different wording. That check runs after embedding, as a housekeeping pass over the index, using the same \`cosine_similarity\` function you already built.

## Budgeting the embedding cost before you index

Embedding is billed per token, like any model call. Before indexing a big vault, estimate the bill.

\`\`\`python
def estimate_tokens(text):
    return max(1, len(text) // 4)

def estimate_index_cost(chunks, cost_per_1k_tokens):
    total_tokens = sum(estimate_tokens(c["text"]) for c in chunks)
    return total_tokens, (total_tokens / 1000) * cost_per_1k_tokens
\`\`\`

Dedup first, then estimate. Dropping duplicate chunks lowers this number directly, which is why dedup belongs in the hardening lessons. It is a real cost lever on a vault of any size.

## Why this matters

At ten notes, duplication is a curiosity. At a thousand notes with a shared daily template, it can be a third of your entire index. That triples embedding cost and dilutes every retrieval with repeated boilerplate that was never worth searching.

\`\`\`python
def notes_brain(question, index, confident_t=0.5, weak_t=0.3):

    cited = extract_citations(answer)
    invalid = verify_citations(cited, len(hits))
    notes = footnotes(cited, hits)

\`\`\`

Read it top to bottom and you are reading the whole project: retrieve, gate on confidence, prompt with numbered sources, call the model, extract and verify citations, hand back an answer plus a clean footnote list. If verification fails, hand back an empty footnote list, which beats showing a broken citation.

## Cache the index, don't rebuild it every run

Embedding every note on every question would be slow and wasteful. Real tools embed once, save the vectors with a hash of each chunk's text as the cache key, and re-embed only the chunks whose text changed since last time. That one habit is what turns a tool that runs once as a demo into one that runs instantly and cheaply every day on a growing vault.

## Wrap it as a CLI

\`\`\`python
import sys

def main():
    question = " ".join(sys.argv[1:]) or sys.stdin.read().strip()
    index = load_or_build_index("notes/")
    answer, notes = notes_brain(question, index)
    print(answer)
    for n in notes:
        print(n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
\`\`\`

Now \`python notes_brain.py "what did I decide about the budget?"\` reads your real vault and answers with footnotes, or admits it found nothing.

## What "shipped" means here

It runs from a clean start with one command. It handles an empty vault or an off-topic question without crashing or fabricating. And someone else could point it at their own notes folder from your instructions alone.
