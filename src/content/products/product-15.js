      title: "Turn a PDF Into Text You Can Search",
      concept: "chunking a document",
      explanation: `A chatbot that "reads" your PDF never touches the whole file when you ask a question. It never sees the PDF at all. What it sees are a few small pieces of text you pick out and paste into the prompt. This lesson builds the first piece: turn a document into text, then slice that text into pieces small enough to search and cheap enough to send.

## What we're building

By lesson 8 you'll have a working app. Upload a document, ask a question, get an answer sourced from the document. That is **RAG**, retrieval-augmented generation: pull the relevant pieces of a document, then generate an answer grounded in them. Every RAG app begins by getting clean text out of the source file.

## Extracting the text

A PDF is a page-layout format, not plain text, so you need a library to pull the text out:

\`\`\`python
from pypdf import PdfReader

def extract_text(path):
    reader = PdfReader(path)
    return "\\n".join(page.extract_text() or "" for page in reader.pages)
\`\`\`

The \`or ""\` matters: a scanned image page has no extractable text and returns \`None\`, which would crash a join. Guard it and move on.

## Why you can't just paste the whole thing in

Two reasons. First, the **context window**: the model reads only so many tokens per call, and a real document blows past that limit fast. Second, and this holds even when the document does fit: dumping 40 pages into every question burns tokens you pay for and buries the one paragraph that answers the question under 39 pages that don't. Search the document first. Then hand the model only the slice it needs.

## Chunking: cut it into searchable pieces

**Chunking** splits the full text into overlapping windows of a few hundred to a thousand characters each. Each chunk becomes a separately searchable unit later.

\`\`\`python
def chunk_text(text, size=800, overlap=100):
    chunks = []
    start = 0
    while start < len(text):
        chunks.append(text[start:start + size])
        start += size - overlap
    return chunks
\`\`\`

Two knobs matter. \`size\` sets how big each chunk is: big enough to hold a full idea, small enough to stay precise once retrieved. \`overlap\` repeats a little text between consecutive chunks so an idea sitting right on a boundary doesn't get sliced in half and lost from both windows.

## A way to picture it

Think of the document as a long hallway of paragraphs. Chunking drops a marker every few hundred characters and lets neighboring markers share a bit of hallway so nothing falls in a gap. None of this understands meaning yet. Ranking comes next lesson. Right now the job is exactly one long string in, a list of overlapping windows out. Build that below in pure Python. You don't need a PDF yet.`,

      title: "Turning Text Into Numbers: Embeddings",
      concept: "embeddings",
      explanation: `You have a pile of text chunks. To find the ones relevant to a question, you need to compare meaning, and a computer can't compare meaning directly. It compares numbers. An **embedding** is how you turn meaning into numbers it can work with.

## What an embedding is

An embedding model takes a piece of text and returns a **vector**: a fixed-length list of floating-point numbers, often a thousand or more, that places the text's meaning as a point in space. Texts about similar things point in similar directions. "The cat sat on the mat" and "a feline rested on the rug" land close together even though they share no words. That closeness is the whole basis of RAG search.

## Calling an embedding model

Anthropic recommends Voyage AI for embeddings. You call it like any other model API: text goes in, vectors come back.

\`\`\`python
import os
import voyageai

vo = voyageai.Client(api_key=os.environ["VOYAGE_API_KEY"])

result = vo.embed(
    ["The cat sat on the mat.", "Paris is the capital of France."],
    model="voyage-3",
    input_type="document",
)
vectors = result.embeddings
print(len(vectors), len(vectors[0]))   # e.g. 2 chunks, 1024 numbers each
\`\`\`

You embed every chunk **once**, right after chunking, and store each vector next to its chunk text. At query time you embed the user's *question* with the same model and compare that one vector against every stored chunk vector. Same embedding call, different input.

## Vectors as plain lists of numbers

Strip away the API and a vector is just \`[0.12, -0.87, 0.33, ...]\`. Two measurements carry the rest of this project:

- **Magnitude** (length): how big the vector is, the square root of the sum of its squared components.
- **Direction**: which way it points. This is the part that encodes meaning.

\`\`\`python
def magnitude(v):
    return sum(x * x for x in v) ** 0.5

def normalize(v):
    m = magnitude(v)
    return [x / m for x in v] if m else v
\`\`\`

\`normalize\` rescales a vector to length 1 while keeping its direction. That's handy because next lesson's similarity measure cares about direction, not size.

## What's actually yours to write

You never write the embedding math. The model does that. Your job is the plumbing: embed each chunk once, store the vectors, embed the question at query time, and pass both to a similarity function. Get the vector bookkeeping right here and the retrieval logic next lesson is arithmetic on lists.

## A way to picture it

An embedding is a GPS coordinate for meaning. Two texts about the same topic sit near each other on the map. Two unrelated texts sit far apart. Below, practice the magnitude and normalization math you'll reach for in the next lesson. No network call needed.`,

      title: "Finding the Best Match: Cosine Similarity",
      concept: "cosine similarity retrieval",
      explanation: `You have a vector for every chunk and, in a moment, a vector for the user's question. Now you need one number that answers "how relevant is this chunk to this question." That number is **cosine similarity**. It's what turns a pile of vectors into a ranked search result.

## Why not just compare the raw numbers?

You might reach for the dot product: multiply matching entries, sum the results. The catch is that the dot product grows with vector *length*, not just direction. A long, verbose chunk can score high because its numbers are bigger, not because it answers the question. You want to compare direction and throw away size.

## Cosine similarity

Cosine similarity divides the dot product by the product of both vectors' magnitudes, which cancels out length and leaves only direction:

\`\`\`python
def dot(a, b):
    return sum(x * y for x, y in zip(a, b))

def magnitude(v):
    return sum(x * x for x in v) ** 0.5

def cosine_similarity(a, b):
    ma, mb = magnitude(a), magnitude(b)
    if ma == 0 or mb == 0:
        return 0.0
    return dot(a, b) / (ma * mb)
\`\`\`

The result always falls between -1 and 1. **1** means the vectors point the same way (near-identical meaning). **0** means unrelated. **-1** means opposite. In practice, relevant chunks for a real question land somewhere around 0.2 to 0.6 and rarely near 1.

## Retrieval is just ranking

Retrieval means: embed the question, compute cosine similarity against every stored chunk vector, and take the highest-scoring ones.

\`\`\`python
def retrieve(question_vector, chunk_vectors):
    scored = [
        (chunk_id, cosine_similarity(question_vector, v))
        for chunk_id, v in chunk_vectors.items()
    ]
    scored.sort(key=lambda pair: -pair[1])
    return scored
\`\`\`

That's the entire search engine underneath a RAG app. No keyword index, no query language, just sorted arithmetic on lists of numbers.

## Where it earns its keep

This one function is why RAG beats keyword search on real questions. A user asks "how much does it cost to cancel early" and matches a chunk that says "early termination incurs a fee." They share no words. The embeddings still land close in meaning-space, so the match holds.

## A way to picture it

Every chunk is a point on a meaning-map, and the question is another point dropped onto the same map. Cosine similarity reads the angle between the question and each chunk from the origin rather than the straight-line distance, so a short chunk and a long chunk that say the same thing score the same. Below, implement cosine similarity and use it to rank a few chunks against a query. No network required.`,

      title: "Retrieve Then Ask: Assembling the RAG Prompt",
      concept: "the RAG prompt",
      explanation: `You can find the chunks most relevant to a question. The next step turns "here are three relevant chunks" into a prompt the model answers from correctly, without inventing anything the chunks never said.

## The RAG prompt has a fixed shape

A RAG prompt always carries three parts: the rules, the retrieved context, and the question.

\`\`\`python
def build_context(chunks):
    return "\\n\\n".join(f"[{i + 1}] {c['text']}" for i, c in enumerate(chunks))

SYSTEM = """You are a helpful assistant that answers using ONLY the provided context.
Cite the source number(s) you used in brackets, like [1] or [2][3].
If the answer is not in the context, say you don't know. Do not guess."""

def build_rag_request(question, chunks):
    context = build_context(chunks)
    user = f"Context:\\n{context}\\n\\nQuestion: {question}"
    return {
        "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
        "max_tokens": 500,
        "system": SYSTEM,
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": user}],
    }
\`\`\`

Notice each chunk gets a **number label**: \`[1]\`, \`[2]\`, and so on. That label lets the model cite its source, and it lets you check later that a citation points at a real chunk rather than a number the model invented.

## Why the system prompt is worded this way

Three lines carry most of the weight of a trustworthy RAG app:

1. **"ONLY the provided context"** stops the model from answering out of its own general knowledge when the document doesn't cover the topic. That's the biggest single source of RAG hallucination.
2. **"Cite the source number(s)"** gives you a way to verify the answer is grounded, and gives the user a way to check it too.
3. **"If the answer is not in the context, say you don't know"** hands the model a permitted way to refuse instead of confabulating a plausible wrong answer.

## Calling it

\`\`\`python
resp = client.messages.create(**build_rag_request(question, top_chunks))
answer = resp.content[0].text
\`\`\`

Everything before this call is search. Everything from here is a normal model call, the same shape as any other project in this track. The API call doesn't change for RAG. You just feed it smarter input.

## A way to picture it

A RAG prompt is an open-book exam question. You hand the model the exact pages it's allowed to use, numbered, and tell it to cite the page each fact came from. It can't flip to a page you never handed it. Below, build the context-assembly and prompt-building step in pure Python. No network call needed.`,

      title: "Multiple Chunks: Top-K and Deduplication",
      concept: "top-k retrieval and deduplication",
      explanation: `A real question is often answered by more than one paragraph, spread across the document. So you retrieve the top few chunks, not just the single best one. But the overlapping windows from lesson 1 introduce a new problem: several of your top matches can be near-duplicates of each other, and three copies of the same sentence eat prompt budget without adding a thing.

## Top-k retrieval

**Top-k** means "take the k highest-scoring chunks instead of one." A typical RAG app sets k between 3 and 6.

\`\`\`python
def top_k(scored_chunks, k):
    ranked = sorted(scored_chunks, key=lambda c: -c["score"])
    return ranked[:k]
\`\`\`

That's enough for a document with no overlap. But your chunker used a sliding window, so chunk 4 and chunk 5 can share most of their text by design. If both score high, top-k hands the model the same sentence twice under two different labels.

## Deduplicating near-identical chunks

Here's a cheap check that works: if one chunk's text sits entirely inside another's, they say the same thing, so drop the shorter one.

\`\`\`python
def is_duplicate(candidate, kept):
    return any(
        candidate["text"] in existing["text"] or existing["text"] in candidate["text"]
        for existing in kept
    )
\`\`\`

## Combine them: scan until you have k unique chunks

Don't dedupe after slicing the top k, because that can leave you with fewer than k chunks. Instead, scan in score order, skip duplicates as you go, and stop once you've collected k unique chunks:

\`\`\`python
def retrieve_unique(scored_chunks, k):
    ranked = sorted(scored_chunks, key=lambda c: -c["score"])
    kept = []
    for c in ranked:
        if is_duplicate(c, kept):
            continue
        kept.append(c)
        if len(kept) == k:
            break
    return kept
\`\`\`

This keeps looking past the naive top-k cutoff, so a duplicate at rank 2 doesn't quietly shrink your final context below the k chunks you asked for.

## Where it earns its keep

Without dedup, overlapping chunks eat your context budget. You can send 3 chunks that really cover 2 distinct ideas, paying tokens to repeat one sentence. Scanning past duplicates instead of cutting at a fixed rank means your k chunks are k genuinely different pieces of the document.

## A way to picture it

Top-k picks the highest scores. Dedup makes sure you don't pick the same paragraph twice under two different chunk IDs. Below, implement the scan-and-skip retrieval described above. No network needed, just ranking and substring checks.`,

      title: "When the Answer Isn't in the Document",
      concept: "grounding and refusal",
      explanation: `The worst failure in a RAG app is rarely a crash. It's a confident, well-written answer that happens to be wrong because the document never covered the question. This lesson catches that before it reaches the user.

## Two guards, two jobs

- **Before the call**: if nothing retrieved is actually relevant, don't ask the model at all. Say so.
- **After the call**: if the model cites a source, check the citation is real.

## Guard one: the similarity floor

Cosine similarity hands you a warning sign for free. If the *best* chunk still scores low, the document probably doesn't cover the topic, and no amount of clever prompting fixes that. Set a floor and refuse below it:

\`\`\`python
def should_answer(top_score, threshold=0.2):
    return top_score >= threshold

if not should_answer(ranked[0]["score"]):
    print("I don't know based on the document.")
else:
    resp = client.messages.create(**build_rag_request(question, kept_chunks))
    print(resp.content[0].text)
\`\`\`

It also saves money. A question with no relevant match skips the more expensive generation call entirely.

## Guard two: citation validation

Even with good context, a model will sometimes cite a source number that doesn't exist, like "[5]" when you sent only 3 chunks. That's a small but real hallucination. Catch it with a regex:

\`\`\`python
import re

def extract_citations(text):
    return sorted({int(n) for n in re.findall(r"\\[(\\d+)\\]", text)})

def citations_valid(citations, num_chunks):
    return all(1 <= c <= num_chunks for c in citations)
\`\`\`

If \`citations_valid\` fails, treat the answer as untrustworthy. Retry, strip the bad citation, or fall back to "I couldn't verify this answer."

## Where it earns its keep

A RAG app that never says "I don't know" is harder to trust, because you can't tell its confident wrong answers from its confident right ones. The similarity floor and the citation check cost almost nothing. They're what separates a demo that shines on the happy path from a tool people rely on when the document falls short.

## A way to picture it

Treat every answer as a claim that has to show its work. No relevant chunk above the floor means the model shouldn't even try. A citation pointing outside the numbered sources you sent means the model is quoting something you never gave it. Below, implement both checks in pure Python.`,

      title: "Harden: Big PDFs, Embedding Cost, and Bad Input",
      concept: "robustness and cost",
      explanation: `Your app works on the one clean PDF you tested with. A real user uploads a 300-page manual, re-uploads the same file twice, asks a blank question, or loses the network mid-embed. This lesson closes those gaps.

## Embedding costs money, per chunk

Every chunk you embed is an API call (batched or not) that costs tokens. A 300-page manual chunked at 800 characters can produce hundreds of chunks, so hundreds of embedding calls on every upload. That bill climbs fast when users re-upload the same document.

## Cache embeddings by content

The fix is simple. Hash each chunk's exact text and skip any chunk you've already embedded.

\`\`\`python
import hashlib

def chunk_hash(text):
    return hashlib.sha256(text.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()

def embed_new_only(chunks, cache):
    to_embed = [c for c in chunks if chunk_hash(c) not in cache]
    if to_embed:
        vectors = vo.embed(to_embed, model="voyage-3", input_type="document").embeddings
        for text, vec in zip(to_embed, vectors):
            cache[chunk_hash(text)] = vec
    return {chunk_hash(c): cache[chunk_hash(c)] for c in chunks}
\`\`\`

An unchanged re-upload now costs zero new embedding calls. Only new or edited chunks get billed.

## Guard the edges before you spend anything

\`\`\`python
def prepare_upload(text, question):
    text = text.strip()
    if not text:
        raise ValueError("The document had no extractable text.")
    if not question.strip():
        raise ValueError("Ask a question before searching the document.")
\`\`\`

A scanned PDF with no OCR text, or a user hitting "ask" with an empty box, should fail with a clear message. Not a mysterious empty-vector crash three functions later.

## Retry the flaky call, but count every attempt

Embedding and generation calls both time out now and then. Wrap them in a retry. And when you tally cost, remember that every attempt spent input tokens, failed ones included:

\`\`\`python
import time

def call_with_retry(fn, tries=3):
    for attempt in range(tries):
        try:
            return fn()
        except Exception:
            if attempt == tries - 1:
                raise
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)
\`\`\`

## Where it earns its keep

RAG apps look cheap in a demo and turn expensive in production, because the embedding step scales with document size and re-uploads, not with how many questions people ask. Caching by content hash is the highest-leverage fix here. Most re-uploads edit a handful of pages, not the whole document.

\`\`\`

Nothing here is new. It's every earlier lesson's function called in the order you built them: ingest once per document, then \`ask\` once per question. The questions run cheap because the expensive chunking and embedding already happened.

## Wrap it in a small CLI

\`\`\`python
import sys

def main():
    path = sys.argv[1]
    chunks, vectors = ingest(path)
    print(f"Loaded {len(chunks)} chunks from {path}. Ask a question, or Ctrl+C to quit.")
    while True:
        question = input("> ")
        print(ask(question, chunks, vectors))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
\`\`\`

One command, \`python chat_pdf.py report.pdf\`, then a loop of questions. Ingest runs once. Every question after that reuses the same chunks and vectors.

## What "shipped" means here

The same three checks from the playbook. It runs from a clean start with one command. It survives an empty document or a blank question without crashing (lesson 7's guards). And it refuses honestly instead of hallucinating when the document doesn't cover the question (lesson 6). Hit those three and you have a real deliverable.

Finishing this lesson records Chat With Your PDF in your **Portfolio** tab. Keep one real document and a question-and-answer pair around as proof it retrieves and grounds correctly. That's your demo.
