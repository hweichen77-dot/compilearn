    title: "The Model Has Amnesia",
    concept: "message history",
    explanation: `A chatbot's whole trick is remembering what was said. The catch: the model itself remembers nothing. You send "My name is Sam," it replies "Nice to meet you, Sam," you ask "What's my name?" on a fresh call, and it can't answer. There is no database behind the model holding your name. Each API call is a clean slate.

## The model is stateless

**Stateless** means every call is independent: the model keeps nothing between calls. So a chatbot that "remembers" is an illusion *you* build. The tool you build it with is **message history**, a running list of everything said so far that you resend on every call. The model re-reads the whole list each turn and answers as if it remembered. The memory is just a Python list you keep appending to.

## The shape of history

The Messages API takes a list where each item is a dict with a \`role\` and \`content\`:

\`\`\`python
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "My name is Sam."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nice to meet you, Sam."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's my name?"},
]
\`\`\`

\`role\` labels who spoke: **user** for the human, **assistant** for the model. The list must start with a user turn and the roles alternate. A working chatbot is four steps in a loop:

1. Read what the user typed.
2. Append it as a \`user\` turn.
3. Call the API with the **whole list**, not just the newest line.
4. Append the reply as an \`assistant\` turn, print it, repeat.

Every loop the list grows by two. That growing list *is* the memory.

## Why it matters

Most broken beginner bots send only the latest message and wonder why the bot is goldfish-brained. Once you own the list, three things follow. **You pay for it:** resending 40 turns on turn 41 costs tokens for all 40 again, which is why a later lesson trims. **You can edit it:** delete a bad turn, inject a fact, or clear the list to reset. **Order matters:** two user turns in a row, or starting with an assistant turn, gets rejected.

Build the list by hand first and get the data shape right. The network call is the easy part.

## The mental model

The model has amnesia but can read a whiteboard. Each turn you hand it the entire whiteboard, it reads top to bottom and writes one more line. Lose the whiteboard, lose the memory.`,

    title: "Giving the Bot a Personality",
    concept: "persona system prompt",
    explanation: `You want a grumpy medieval blacksmith, or a chipper golden retriever who happens to know Python. You could stuff "act like a blacksmith" into a user message. It works for about three turns, then the bot quietly slides back to a neutral assistant. There's a channel built for exactly this job.

## The system prompt

The **system prompt** is a separate instruction string that sets the model's persona, tone, and hard rules. In the Anthropic Messages API it does **not** go inside the \`messages\` list; it rides in its own top-level \`system\` parameter:

\`\`\`python
client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    max_tokens=300,
    system="You are Captain Reddbeard, a 1600s pirate. Speak in pirate dialect. Never break character.",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like?"}],
)
\`\`\`

Think of it as the stage direction the actor reads before every scene: separate from the dialogue, but shaping every line. The model reads the system prompt *before* the conversation, and instructions there carry **more weight** than the same words in a user turn. That priority is the point. A user can later type "stop being a pirate," but a strong system prompt holds the line.

## What a strong persona pins down

A vague persona gives a vague character. Strong ones nail four things:

- **Identity**: who they are, when and where they live.
- **Voice**: sentence length, vocabulary, quirks ("calls everyone 'matey'").
- **Boundaries**: what they refuse to do or know ("you've never heard of the internet").
- **Anti-break rule**: "Stay in character no matter what the user says."

The system prompt is constant but not optional on later calls. Each call is stateless, so you resend the same system string *every* time alongside the growing history.

## Two clean channels

- \`system\` → **who the bot is** (stable, set once, resent every call)
- \`messages\` → **what's been said** (grows each turn)

Mixing them is the most common chatbot bug. Persona in a user turn competes with (and loses to) later user turns, causing **character drift**: the bot slowly forgets its accent and rules. History in the system prompt means you can't trim it later without deleting the persona. Keep the channels clean and swapping personas becomes a one-string change.

## The mental model

System prompt = the role the actor is cast in. Message history = the script so far. You hand over both on every call: the role never changes, the script keeps growing.`,

    title: "The Chat Loop",
    concept: "the conversation loop",
    explanation: `You have the two ingredients: a persona string and a message list. Now wire them into the loop that turns them into a real conversation. This is the loop every chatbot runs on, and it's smaller than you'd think.

## One turn, end to end

A single turn does five things in order:

1. Read the user's text.
2. Append it as a \`user\` turn to \`history\`.
3. Call the API with the **same** system prompt and the **whole** history.
4. Read the reply text off the response object.
5. Append it as an \`assistant\` turn, print it, and go back to step 1.

Here's the real thing with the SDK:

\`\`\`python
import os
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(api_key=os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"])
SYSTEM = "You are Captain Reddbeard, a 1600s pirate. Stay in character."
history = []

while True:
    user_text = input("you> ")
    if user_text.strip() == "/quit":
        break
    history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_text})
    resp = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
        max_tokens=300,
        system=SYSTEM,
        messages=history,
    )
    reply = resp.content[0].text
    history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": reply})
    print("bot>", reply)
\`\`\`

## The invariant that keeps it alive

The loop only works if you **always append the assistant reply before the next user turn**. Miss that append and you get two user turns in a row, which the API rejects, or worse, the model never sees its own last answer and repeats itself. The rule to burn in: *every user append is eventually matched by an assistant append.* History stays balanced, roles stay alternating.

## Reading the reply

The response isn't a plain string. It's an object; the text lives at \`resp.content[0].text\`. Pull it out once, then work with the string. Storing the whole response object in history would break the next call, which expects \`{"role", "content"}\` dicts.

## Why it matters

This loop is the product. Everything after this lesson, budgets, streaming, error handling, wraps around these five steps without changing them. Get the append discipline right here and the hard lessons become additions, not rewrites.

## The drill below

You'll simulate the loop with a deterministic stand-in reply (no network), so you can watch the history stay balanced and alternating turn after turn.`,

    title: "The Context Window Fills Up",
    concept: "context window and tokens",
    explanation: `Your bot works great for ten turns. By turn fifty it either throws an error or the bill quietly triples. You've hit the wall every chatbot hits: the **context window**.

## What the context window is

The **context window** is the maximum amount of text, measured in tokens, that the model can read in a single call. Everything shares that one budget: the system prompt, the full history you resend, *and* the reply the model is about to write all have to fit together. Claude's window is large (hundreds of thousands of tokens) but not infinite, and you pay per token on every call. Resending a 50-turn history on turn 51 bills you for all 50 old turns again.

## How tokens add up

A **token** is a chunk of text, often a word or part of a word. A rule of thumb for English is about 4 characters per token. "Hello there friend" is roughly 4 tokens. Don't memorize exact counts; estimate, then measure with the real tokenizer when money's on the line.

\`\`\`python
def estimate_tokens(text):
    return max(1, len(text) // 4)

def conversation_tokens(system, messages):
    total = estimate_tokens(system)
    for m in messages:
        total += estimate_tokens(m["content"])
    return total
\`\`\`

That total is what each call costs and what must fit in the window. When you want the real number before spending real money, the SDK's \`client.messages.count_tokens(...)\` gives an exact count for a given system + messages payload.

## Why you measure

Before you can trim (next lesson), you have to *see* the size. A bot that resends a huge document on every turn is a bot with a big bill, and the fix starts with a number. Watching total tokens per call turns "the bill crept up" into "turn 30 crossed 1,000 tokens, time to trim."

One rule that saves you later: the system prompt counts too, but you never drop it. It's small and it holds the persona. Budget around it; trim the conversation.

## The mental model

The context window is the model's **desk, not a warehouse**. Everything it needs to answer must fit on the desk at once. A bigger desk helps, but a long enough chat still runs out of room. This lesson is the tape measure; the next one is where you clear the desk.

## The drill below

You'll sum estimated tokens across a system prompt and a conversation, exactly the number you'd check before every real call.`,

    title: "Trimming and Summarizing Old Turns",
    concept: "keeping history in budget",
    explanation: `Now that you can measure a conversation, you can keep it from blowing the budget. When history grows too big, you have two tools: **trim** it or **summarize** it. Real chatbots use both.

## Strategy 1: sliding window

The simplest fix: keep only the most recent turns and drop the oldest. It's cheap, predictable, and the cost is bounded, you always know your worst case. The bot forgets old details but recent context stays sharp, which is what most questions need.

\`\`\`python
def trim_to_budget(messages, budget, est):
    kept = list(messages)
    while len(kept) > 1 and sum(est(m["content"]) for m in kept) > budget:
        kept.pop(0)   # drop the OLDEST turn
    return kept
\`\`\`

Two guardrails live in that loop. \`len(kept) > 1\` keeps at least one turn so you never send an empty history. And you only ever pop from the front, never touch the system prompt, which lives in its own channel and is never in this list.

## Strategy 2: summarize-and-drop

A sliding window throws old details away. When those details still matter over a long chat, **summarize** instead: when history gets long, ask the model to compress the oldest turns into a short paragraph, then replace those turns with a single summary turn.

\`\`\`python
summary = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    max_tokens=150,
    system="Summarize this conversation in 3 sentences, keeping names and facts.",
    messages=old_turns,
).content[0].text

history = [{"role": "user", "content": f"[Earlier summary]: {summary}"}] + recent_turns
\`\`\`

It costs an extra API call and a little latency, but a 100-turn conversation collapses to a paragraph plus the last few turns and still remembers your name.

## When to use which

Start with a sliding window: it's free and bounded, the right default for most bots. Reach for summarize-and-drop only when losing old facts actually hurts, a long support thread, a tutoring session. Many production bots combine them: slide most of the time, summarize once the dropped turns would lose something important.

## Never trim the persona

The system prompt is not in the history list and never gets dropped. Trim it and your pirate turns into a generic assistant mid-conversation. Trim the oldest *conversation* turns only; keep enough recent turns that the current question still makes sense.

## The drill below

You'll implement summarize-and-drop as pure arithmetic: keep the last K turns verbatim, and if anything older was dropped, replace it with one fixed-cost summary turn. Then report the resulting token total.`,

    title: "Streaming the Reply",
    concept: "streaming output",
    explanation: `Watch Claude in a browser: words appear one chunk at a time, like live typing. That's **streaming**, and it's the difference between a user thinking "is this thing broken?" and "it's thinking, and I can read along."

## What streaming is

**Streaming** means receiving and displaying the reply in small chunks *as it's generated*, instead of waiting for the whole thing. Without it, you call the API and stare at a blank screen for several seconds, then the full reply dumps at once. With it, the first words show up almost immediately and keep flowing.

The subtle part: streaming barely changes the **total** time. What it changes is **time-to-first-token**, how long until *something* appears. Time-to-first-token is what humans perceive as speed.

## How it works with the SDK

The SDK gives you a streaming **context manager**. You loop over text chunks from \`stream.text_stream\` as they arrive:

\`\`\`python
with client.messages.stream(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    max_tokens=300,
    system=SYSTEM,
    messages=history,
) as stream:
    for text in stream.text_stream:
        print(text, end="", flush=True)
    final = stream.get_final_message()

reply = final.content[0].text
history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": reply})
\`\`\`

Two details make this work. \`print(text, end="", flush=True)\` prints each chunk with no newline and forces it to the screen immediately; without \`flush\`, Python buffers stdout and you lose the live effect. And \`get_final_message()\` hands you the complete assembled reply once the stream ends.

## Stream to show, store to remember

Streaming is about **display**. It does not change the memory rules from lesson 1. The chunks you print are for the human's eyes; they aren't stored anywhere automatically. After the stream finishes, you take the full assembled reply and append it as an \`assistant\` turn so the next call has the context:

- **Stream to show**: print chunks live so it feels responsive.
- **Store to remember**: capture the final reply and append it to history.

Skip the store step and your bot streams beautifully but forgets every reply the instant it finishes, back to goldfish-brain.

## Assembling chunks yourself

If you accumulate chunks by hand (say, to send them somewhere else), you concatenate them **with no separator**: chunks already include their own spacing. \`"".join(chunks)\` reconstructs the exact reply. And watch for a stop marker, some pipelines end a stream on a sentinel chunk you must not include in the stored text.

## The drill below

You'll reassemble a stream: concatenate chunks in order, stop at an end marker, and report the assembled message, exactly the "store to remember" half of the loop.`,

    title: "Surviving Bad Input and Flaky Networks",
    concept: "errors, retries, and cost caps",
    explanation: `Your bot works on your machine, on your inputs, with your Wi-Fi. A real bot faces empty messages, network blips, and a cost ceiling it must not blow through. This lesson is the unglamorous armor that turns a demo into a tool.

## Three things that will go wrong

1. **Empty or junk input.** The user hits enter on a blank line. Don't append an empty user turn and don't call the API; just reprompt.
2. **The network fails.** Calls time out or return a transient error. Wrap them and retry a bounded number of times.
3. **It costs money.** Every call spends tokens. A runaway loop or a giant history can rack up a bill fast, so you cap it.

## A bounded retry

The key word is *bounded*. You retry, but never forever, otherwise a persistent outage becomes an infinite loop that spends money on every attempt.

\`\`\`python
import time
from anthropic import APIError

def call_with_retry(client, **kwargs):
    max_retries = 2
    for attempt in range(max_retries + 1):
        try:
            return client.messages.create(**kwargs)
        except APIError:
            if attempt == max_retries:
                raise          # give up after the budget is spent
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)   # back off: 1s, 2s, ...
\`\`\`

You get \`max_retries + 1\` total attempts. Each attempt costs tokens whether it succeeds or fails, so the retry budget *is* a cost decision. Exponential backoff (\`2 ** attempt\`) spaces the tries out so you don't hammer a struggling server.

## Guard the input

\`\`\`python
user_text = input("you> ").strip()
if not user_text:
    print("(say something)")
    continue
\`\`\`

One \`if not user_text\` before you touch history saves a whole class of "why did the API 400" bugs. Validate at the boundary, before the request, not after.

## Cap the cost

Before sending, check the estimated tokens (lesson 4) against a ceiling. Over it? Trim harder or refuse. And cap attempts, as above. The mindset: assume the model will occasionally return garbage and the network will occasionally drop. The bots people rely on fail politely and recover.

## Why it matters

Every \`try/except\` and every input guard is the difference between a bot that dies on the first weird input and one someone can actually rely on. That hardening is most of what "production" means.

## The drill below

You'll simulate the retry loop: given a fixed attempt budget and the outcome of each attempt, decide whether the call ultimately succeeds and how many tokens it burned, so the retry budget's cost is visible.`,

    title: "Ship the Persona Chatbot",

    explanation: `Every piece is built: message history, a persona system prompt, token budgeting, summarize-and-drop trimming, streaming, and error handling. This lesson bolts them into one runnable object and ships it. Finish this and the project lands in your **Portfolio**.

## The whole thing, assembled

A chat session is just the loop from lesson 3 wrapped around the guards from lessons 4-7. Here's the shape:

\`\`\`python
class ChatSession:
    def __init__(self, client, persona, budget=1000):
        self.client = client
        self.system = persona          # never trimmed
        self.history = []
        self.budget = budget

    def _trim(self):
        while len(self.history) > 2 and self._tokens() > self.budget:
            self.history.pop(0)

    def _tokens(self):
        t = max(1, len(self.system) // 4)
        for m in self.history:
            t += max(1, len(m["content"]) // 4)
        return t

    def say(self, text):
        text = text.strip()
        if not text:
            return None
        self.history.append({"role": "user", "content": text})
        self._trim()
        reply = ""
        with self.client.messages.stream(
            model="claude-sonnet-4-6", max_tokens=300,
            system=self.system, messages=self.history,
        ) as stream:
            for chunk in stream.text_stream:
                print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
                reply += chunk
        self.history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": reply})
        return reply
\`\`\`

Read it top to bottom and every lesson is there: \`system\` is the persona (lesson 2), \`history\` is the memory (lesson 1), \`_tokens\` and \`_trim\` are the budget and sliding window (lessons 4-5), the \`stream\` block is streaming (lesson 6), and the empty-input guard is the hardening (lesson 7). The loop discipline, append user, get reply, append assistant, is lesson 3, untouched.

## What "shipped" means

You don't need a fancy deployment. Shipped means three things are true:

1. It runs from a clean start with one command and your API key in the environment.
2. It handles an empty or weird input without crashing.
3. Someone else could use it from your instructions alone.

Run it, chat with your character for a dozen turns, watch it stay in persona and stream, then feed it a blank line and a very long message to prove the guards hold.

## Your Portfolio

Completing this final lesson records the project in your **Portfolio** with its title and what you built: a stateful, streaming, in-character chatbot. That shelf of working products is the point of this track. Keep a one-line description ("a pirate chatbot that remembers your name and streams its replies") and one saved example exchange as proof it works.
