    explanation:
      "A vision model never opens a photo file. It reads bytes that have been base64-encoded into text and packed into a JSON content block next to your prompt. This lesson builds that payload. Every later lesson reuses it.\n\n## What multimodal input means\n\nA normal text call sends one string. A vision call sends a list of content blocks: one block holds the image, another holds your text instruction. The model reads both as parts of the same message and reasons over them together.\n\n## Turning a file into base64\n\nA JSON request is text, so it can't carry raw binary. The image bytes get base64-encoded first, which turns them into a long string of safe characters.\n\n```python\nimport base64\n\nwith open(\"photo.jpg\", \"rb\") as f:\n    image_bytes = f.read()\n\nimage_b64 = base64.b64encode(image_bytes).decode(\"utf-8\")\n```\n\n## Building the content block\n\nThe block needs three parts: a `type` of \"image\", a `source` dict that says how the data is encoded, and the base64 string.\n\n```python\ncontent = [\n    {\n        \"type\": \"image\",\n        \"source\": {\n            \"type\": \"base64\",\n            \"media_type\": \"image/jpeg\",\n            \"data\": image_b64,\n        },\n    },\n    {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Describe this image in one sentence.\"},\n]\n```\n\n## Sending it\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom anthropic import Anthropic\n\nclient = Anthropic(api_key=os.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"])\n\nresponse = client.messages.create(\n    model=\"claude-sonnet-4-6\",\n    max_tokens=200,\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": content}],\n)\nprint(response.content[0].text)\n```\n\n## Why media_type matters\n\n`media_type` tells the model how to decode the bytes. The common formats are `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, and `image/gif`. Label a PNG as JPEG and decoding either fails quietly or the model misreads the picture. Take this value from the file's real format. Don't guess it.\n\n## The mental model to keep\n\nEvery vision call is two payloads riding together: a picture translated into text-safe characters, and a sentence that tells the model what to do with it. Captions, alt text, and validation all sit on top of this one content block.",

      "Once the payload is built, the round trip is short: send it, get text back, print it. This lesson is the smallest version of the whole product. It captions one image in about ten lines.\n\n## The request/response shape\n\nYou already know what a message with an image looks like from the last lesson. The reply comes back as a `Message` object, and the text you want sits at `response.content[0].text`, the first content block of the reply.\n\n```python\nresponse = client.messages.create(\n    model=\"claude-sonnet-4-6\",\n    max_tokens=200,\n    messages=[{\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": [\n            {\"type\": \"image\", \"source\": {\"type\": \"base64\", \"media_type\": \"image/jpeg\", \"data\": image_b64}},\n            {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Describe this image in one sentence.\"},\n        ],\n    }],\n)\n\ncaption = response.content[0].text\nprint(caption)\n```\n\n## Why content[0], not just content\n\nThe reply's `content` is a list of blocks that mirrors the request. A plain text reply almost always has exactly one block of type \"text\", but the SDK keeps the list shape so replies mixing text with other block types fit the same structure. You'll write `content[0].text` in nearly every product in this track.\n\n## What the raw response looks like\n\nUnderneath the SDK object, the API returns JSON shaped roughly like this:\n\n```python\n{\n    \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"A golden retriever runs across a grassy park.\"}],\n    \"usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 1204, \"output_tokens\": 12},\n}\n```\n\nThe SDK parses this for you. Knowing the shape still helps, because when a bad key or a malformed reply breaks something, this exact structure is what you debug.\n\n## Why this is the whole loop already\n\nThis is the same six-step loop from the setup module: input (an image), prompt (the instruction), call (the API), parse (content[0].text), verify (lesson 6), ship (print it). Everything from here refines steps 2 through 5 for this one product.\n\n## The mental model to keep\n\nA caption is a text reply where the input happened to include a picture. Once you can pull `content[0].text` from a response, you build the rest of this product by changing what you ask for, not how you ask for it.",

That means two prompts, not one prompt reused twice.\n\n## Two jobs, one image\n\n- A **caption** is for a sighted reader scanning a page. It can be vivid and a little editorial, there to add context or personality (\"A golden retriever bounds through morning fog.\").\n- **Alt text** is for a screen reader user who cannot see the image. It has to replace the picture: plain, complete, and short enough to read aloud without wearing out its welcome (\"A dog running through a foggy field.\").\n\nSend the same \"describe this image\" prompt for both and you get one mediocre result trying to do two jobs. The fix is two separate instructions, picked by mode.\n\n## Writing task-specific prompts\n\n```python\nCAPTION_PROMPT = (\n    \"Write one vivid, natural sentence captioning this image, \"\n    \"as if for a photo essay.

Alt text that starts with \"image of\" doubles that up and wastes the listener's time. A sighted person would never think to ask for this rule. It comes from knowing the audience, not the picture.\n\n## The mental model to keep\n\nThe picture doesn't change between the two calls. The audience does.

      "Ask a model for \"alt text under 125 characters\" and it will sometimes ignore you. Screen reader software doesn't check the model's manners, so your product has to. This lesson builds the validator that catches bad alt text before it ships.\n\n## The three rules that matter most\n\n1. **Length.** Screen readers read alt text aloud in full. A widely used guideline caps useful alt text near 125 characters. Past that it turns into a monologue.\n2. **No redundant phrasing.** Screen readers already announce \"image\" or \"graphic\" before the alt text plays, so text starting with \"image of\" or \"picture of\" makes the user hear it twice.\n3. **Not empty.** Empty alt text is correct only for a truly decorative image. For a content image the reader gets nothing, which is a broken experience.\n\n## Writing the validator\n\n```python\nMAX_ALT_LENGTH = 125\nREDUNDANT_PHRASES = (\"image of\", \"picture of\", \"photo of\")\n\ndef validate_alt_text(alt_text):\n    issues = []\n    if not alt_text.strip():\n        issues.append(\"empty\")\n        return issues\n    if len(alt_text) > MAX_ALT_LENGTH:\n        issues.append(\"too_long\")\n    lowered = alt_text.lower()\n    if any(p in lowered for p in REDUNDANT_PHRASES):\n        issues.append(\"redundant_phrase\")\n    return issues\n```\n\nThe empty check returns right away. There's no point measuring the length of nothing.\n\n## What you do with a failing validator\n\nA validator that only prints \"bad\" doesn't help a product. Retry instead: call again and check the new attempt.\n\n```python\ndef get_valid_alt_text(client, image_content, retries=2):\n    for _ in range(retries + 1):\n        alt = caption_image(client, image_content, \"alt_text\")\n        if not validate_alt_text(alt):\n            return alt\n    return alt  # last attempt, even if imperfect\n```\n\n## Why validation lives outside the prompt\n\nYou could tighten the prompt forever and still get an occasional miss. Models are probabilistic, not compilers. A prompt lowers how often the rule breaks. The validator is what keeps a broken result from ever shipping. Treat the prompt as a suggestion and the validator as the contract.\n\n## The mental model to keep\n\nAccessibility rules are numeric and checkable, so don't leave them to hope. Anything you can write as an `if` statement (length, banned phrases, emptiness) belongs in code, not only in the instructions you send the model.",

This lesson merges them into one call that returns both fields as JSON, then builds a parser that survives the model's habit of wrapping JSON in extra text.\n\n## Asking for both fields at once\n\n```python\nCOMBINED_PROMPT = \"\"\"Look at this image and return ONLY a JSON object with two keys:\n- \"caption\": one vivid sentence for a photo caption\n- \"alt_text\": screen-reader alt text, under 125 characters, not starting with 'image of'\nReturn no other text.\"\"\"\n\nresponse = client.messages.create(\n    model=\"claude-sonnet-4-6\",\n    max_tokens=200,\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [image_content, {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": COMBINED_PROMPT}]}],\n)\nraw_text = response.content[0].text\n```\n\n## What actually comes back\n\nModels are inconsistent about \"return no other text.\" Sometimes you get clean JSON:\n\n```python\n{\"caption\": \"A dog runs in a park.\", \"alt_text\": \"A brown dog running through green grass.\"}\n```\n\nOther times the object arrives wrapped in a markdown fence: three backticks, the word json, a newline, the object, then three backticks again. Call `json.loads()` on that wrapped text and it crashes, because the backticks aren't valid JSON.\n\n## The defensive parser\n\nRather than trust the wrapper, find the outermost braces and parse only what's between them.\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef parse_caption_response(raw_text):\n    start = raw_text.index(\"{\")\n    end = raw_text.rindex(\"}\") + 1\n    return json.loads(raw_text[start:end])\n\nresult = parse_caption_response(raw_text)\nprint(result[\"caption\"])\nprint(result[\"alt_text\"])\n```\n\n`index(\"{\")` finds the first opening brace no matter what came before it, whether a fence or a sentence of preamble. `rindex(\"}\")` finds the last closing brace, so nested structure inside the JSON doesn't throw it off.\n\n## Why one call beats two\n\nEvery request pays a fixed cost for the image tokens. Send the same picture twice, once for a caption and again for alt text, and you pay that cost twice for no reason. One structured reply with both fields is cheaper and faster. The only price is a slightly more careful parser.\n\n## The mental model to keep\n\nTreat the model's raw text as untrusted input, the way you'd treat text a user typed.

      "Lessons 1 through 5 assumed a perfect world: valid images and well-formed JSON. Production images are messy. Wrong formats, huge files, and models that occasionally reply with prose instead of JSON. This lesson adds the guardrails.\n\n## Guard the upload before you spend a token\n\nTwo checks that cost nothing and save a wasted, billed API call:\n\n```python\nALLOWED_TYPES = {\"image/png\", \"image/jpeg\", \"image/webp\", \"image/gif\"}\nMAX_IMAGE_BYTES = 5_000_000  # 5 MB\n\ndef validate_image(image_bytes, media_type):\n    if len(image_bytes) == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"empty image\")\n    if media_type not in ALLOWED_TYPES:\n        raise ValueError(f\"unsupported type: {media_type}\")\n    if len(image_bytes) > MAX_IMAGE_BYTES:\n        raise ValueError(\"image too large, resize before sending\")\n```\n\nRun this before you build the content block. An unsupported format or an oversized file fails on the API side too, but failing locally is instant and free. Failing remotely costs a network round trip and, if you're unlucky, a partial charge.\n\n## Guard the reply after you get it back\n\nThe JSON parser from the last lesson can still fail, because a model occasionally ignores the format instruction. Wrap it in a retry, the same pattern from the setup module:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef get_caption_json(client, image_content, retries=2):\n    for attempt in range(retries + 1):\n        response = client.messages.create(\n            model=\"claude-sonnet-4-6\",\n            max_tokens=200,\n            messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [image_content, {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": COMBINED_PROMPT}]}],\n        )\n        try:\n            return parse_caption_response(response.content[0].text)\n        except (ValueError, KeyError):\n            if attempt == retries:\n                raise\n            time.sleep(1)\n```\n\n## Fallback, not just failure\n\nIf every retry fails, don't crash the tool. Hand back something safe. A generic alt text beats no alt text, and a missing caption beats a broken app.\n\n```python\nFALLBACK = {\"caption\": \"An image.\", \"alt_text\": \"Image, description unavailable.\"}\n```\n\nReserve the fallback for a real exhaustion of retries. Reach for it too early and it hides real bugs.\n\n## Why order matters: cheap checks first\n\nValidate the upload before you spend a call. Validate the reply after you receive one. Do it the other way around, calling the API on a file you already knew was too big, and you spend money on a failure you could have caught in a microsecond.\n\n## The mental model to keep\n\nEvery boundary where untrusted data enters your program (a user's uploaded file, a model's text reply) gets a check.

      "An image doesn't have a fixed price. A phone photo and a thumbnail cost wildly different amounts on the same model call, because vision models charge by pixels, not by file size. This lesson builds the estimator that tells you the bill before you send anything.\n\n## How image tokens are counted\n\nText tokens come from characters. Image tokens come from resolution. A widely used approximation:\n\n```python\ndef estimate_image_tokens(width, height):\n    return (width * height) // 750\n```\n\nA 1000x750 photo costs roughly `750,000 // 750 = 1000` tokens before you write a single word of prompt. A 4000x3000 photo from a modern phone costs sixteen times that, about 16,000 tokens, for the same picture at a bigger size.\n\n## Why this matters for a captioning tool\n\nYour product runs on every image a user uploads, and phone cameras default to resolutions the model doesn't need for a one-sentence caption. Sending a full-resolution photo to ask \"describe this in one sentence\" is like mailing a moving truck to deliver a postcard.\n\n## Deciding when to downscale\n\n```python\nMAX_IMAGE_TOKENS = 1600  # a practical ceiling for this product\n\ndef recommend_resize(width, height):\n    tokens = estimate_image_tokens(width, height)\n    if tokens <= MAX_IMAGE_TOKENS:\n        return None\n    scale = (MAX_IMAGE_TOKENS / tokens) ** 0.5\n    return (int(width * scale), int(height * scale))\n```\n\nThe key idea is scaling both dimensions by the square root of the token ratio. Tokens grow with area (width times height), so to halve the tokens you shrink each side by roughly 71 percent, not 50.\n\n## Estimating the full call cost\n\n```python\ndef estimate_total_tokens(width, height, prompt_tokens, reply_tokens=150):\n    return estimate_image_tokens(width, height) + prompt_tokens + reply_tokens\n```\n\nThe image, your instruction, and the model's reply all draw from the same billed total. None of them are free just because they're short.\n\n## The mental model to keep\n\nTreat resolution the way you'd treat a long paragraph you're about to paste into a prompt. For this job bigger isn't more accurate, only more expensive. A one-sentence caption rarely needs more detail than a modestly sized image already carries.",

That's what a finished product usually is: not new code, but old code assembled in the right order.\n\n## What done means for this tool\n\n1. It runs on a real image file end to end and returns both a caption and alt text.\n2. A bad upload, a wrong type or an empty file, fails fast with a clear message instead of a stack trace from deep inside the API call.\n3. A malformed model reply gets one retry before it falls back. It never crashes the tool.\n4. Someone else can point it at their own photo and get a usable result without reading your source.\n\nWhen those four hold, this is a real deliverable, not a demo script.\n\n## A minimal CLI wrapper\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    path = sys.argv[1]\n    with open(path, \"rb\") as f:\n        image_bytes = f.read()\n    media_type = \"image/jpeg\" if path.lower().endswith((\".jpg\", \".jpeg\")) else \"image/png\"\n    result = process_image(image_bytes, media_type, client)\n    print(\"Caption:\", result[\"caption\"])\n    print(\"Alt text:\", result[\"alt_text\"])\n```\n\n## It lands in your Portfolio\n\nFinishing this lesson completes the project. Like every build in this track, it saves to your **Portfolio** automatically: a working Caption & Alt-Text Generator next to whatever else you've shipped. Keep a sample image and its output handy. That pair is your proof it works.\n\n## The mental model to keep\n\nA finished AI product is rarely one clever trick.
