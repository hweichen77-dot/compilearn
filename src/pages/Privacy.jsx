        <StaggerItem as="div"><Section title="What we collect">
          <p>
            Compilearn is built local-first. Your learning progress, completed lessons, challenges,
            XP, and streaks, is stored in your browser&apos;s localStorage by default and never
            leaves your device unless you create an account.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you sign in with email or Google, we store your progress in our database so it
            syncs across your devices. We keep only your email address, display name, and that
            progress data.
          </p>
        </Section></StaggerItem>

        <StaggerItem as="div"><Section title="What happens to the code you write">
          <p>
            Most code you write runs entirely inside your browser and never leaves your device.
            Python runs locally in a sandboxed worker, and your editor contents are not uploaded
            as you type.
          </p>
          <p>
            Three features do send code off your device, because they cannot work otherwise:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>
              Running C++ or Java sends that program to Compiler Explorer (godbolt.org), which
              compiles and runs it and sends back the output. We ask them not to retain it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Asking the AI tutor for help sends your current code, the program output, and your
              question to Groq, which runs the model that answers you.
            </li>
            <li>
              The prompt playground sends the prompt and test inputs you write to Groq.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We do not sell your code, publish it, or use it to train models. We do not read it
            except when investigating a specific bug you report.
          </p>
        </Section></StaggerItem>

        <StaggerItem as="div"><Section title="Analytics">
          <p>
            We use PostHog for product analytics to understand which lessons work and where people
            get stuck. We record learning events such as &quot;challenge completed&quot;, never your
            code, keystrokes, or personal content. Session recording, autocapture, and automatic
            page-view capture are all switched off, and URLs are stripped of anything sensitive
            before they are sent. Analytics use localStorage, not third-party tracking cookies.
          </p>
        </Section></StaggerItem>

        <StaggerItem as="div"><Section title="Error monitoring">
          <p>
            When something crashes, Sentry collects a technical error report (stack trace, page,
            browser) so we can fix it. These reports do not include your code or progress data, and
            we scrub tokens and email addresses before they are sent.
          </p>
        </Section></StaggerItem>

        <StaggerItem as="div"><Section title="Who else processes your data">
          <p>
            We keep this list short on purpose. Compilearn relies on these companies to work:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>Supabase, for accounts and progress sync</li>
            <li>Google, if you choose to sign in with a Google account</li>
            <li>Groq, for the AI tutor and the prompt playground</li>
            <li>Compiler Explorer (godbolt.org), for running C++ and Java</li>
            <li>PostHog, for product analytics</li>
            <li>Sentry, for crash reports</li>
            <li>Vercel, which hosts the site</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These providers process data on servers in the United States. We do not sell your data
            to anyone, and we do not run ad networks.
          </p>
        </Section></StaggerItem>

        <StaggerItem as="div"><Section title="How long we keep it">
          <p>
            Local progress stays in your browser until you clear it. If you have an account, your
            synced progress is kept until you delete your account, which removes it immediately and
            permanently. Analytics and crash reports are retained by those providers on their own
            schedules, generally under a year.
          </p>
        </Section></StaggerItem>

        <StaggerItem as="div"><Section title="Your data & your rights">
          <p>
            You have the right to access, download, and delete your data at any time. Use the
            controls below, no email or waiting required. Exporting gives you a machine-readable
            JSON copy of everything we hold (local progress and, if you have an account, your synced
            data). Deleting is permanent.
          </p>
