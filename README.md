# CodeFlow

Learn to code by building real things. CodeFlow is a free educational platform
where you write and run actual programs in the browser, with no setup and no toy
sandboxes. A tutor explains why each step works, not only what the answer is.

Available on the web and as a desktop app (macOS/Windows/Linux via Tauri).

## Tracks

CodeFlow spans four tracks of project-based curriculum:

- AI Engineering: build with LLMs, APIs, and modern AI tooling (Python)
- AP Computer Science Principles: the full AP CSP curriculum (Python + pseudocode)
- AP Computer Science A: the full AP CSA curriculum (Java)
- Competitive Coding: algorithmic problem solving (C++)

Across the tracks: 22 projects, 300+ lessons, and 300+ coding
challenges, each with a runnable reference solution verified in CI.

## In-browser code runners

Your code runs for real, right in the lesson:

- Python: in-browser via Pyodide
- Java: remote OpenJDK judge
- C++: Compiler Explorer

## Pricing

Free at launch. No paid tier.

## Tech stack

- React 18 + Vite
- Tailwind CSS + Radix UI (shadcn/ui)
- Tauri (desktop builds)
- Supabase (optional account sync)

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

To build the desktop app:

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

## Authoring content

See [CONTENT_AUTHORING.md](CONTENT_AUTHORING.md) for the lesson data model,
track conventions, and the `verify:solutions` CI gate that compiles and runs
every reference solution against its test cases.
